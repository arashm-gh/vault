Hello and welcome to the vault!
I recommend reading this first and then the `./learning/Formatting for Notes.md` file!

> [!info] This project makes heavy use of LaTeX and Markdown syntax as well as Obsidian note linking. A compatible viewer is recommended.

## Attributions
Thank you the authors whose Textbooks, Videos, Blogs, Essays, Podcasts, and material I have used!
## Sources(-ish)
- `/learning/Formatting for Notes.md` is self made and loosely based off of mathematical syntax.
- I've used mostly textbooks for everything in `/learning/`. 
- Wikipedia and Simple Wikipedia as well as diagrams in textbooks make up `/images/`.
- `/logs/` are all self written because they're logs!
- Paraphrasing Wikipedia and other sources easily found on google, as well as what my personal thoughts on some things are.

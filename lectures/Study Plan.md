> Each course has a number of credit hours! I have nine different classes that could happen at any given time, and they add up to ***15*** credit hours!
> The general rule of thumb is that I spend 2 hours for each credit hour of subject! Here's a table:

| Subject Code | Credit Hours | Study Hours | Course Name                                            |

I'm gonna be mostly busy from 5am to 5pm ($12$ hours of the day) and sleep from 10am to 5am ($7$ hours) this leaves $~5$ hours of free time for the workweek and $17$ hours for Saturday, Sunday.
Realistically I'll only be studying for a maximum of $2$ hours from Monday to Friday which means $30 - (5 \times 2) = 20$ hours for the weekend which means $10$ hours, which is more than unmanageable.
Currently my schedule (which I can hardly follow) gives me $17.5$ hours per week of study, from Monday to Sunday excluding lecture times.
I would like to be able to give every subject the work it desires but I also want time for myself, friends, studying outside of school, and hobbies. I don't see it going past $17.5$ anytime soon.
The next focus point is what I should study when I have time! Here's another table for resources:

| Subject Code | Book Name(s)                                                                          |

Teachers don't usually like to rely on books and it's usually supplementary material but lets see what happens. Some of them did mention them so I imagine they're very important for the course.
For stuff like Material Science I might have to make another folder and put my shit in there, and for chemistry I'll add something to the old folder.
Now we need to decide what to study! I did a tiny bit of math yesterday and it helped a little but it was far too introductory and short to really teach me anything new :( I did make notes though and they were helpful 
I'm gonna take a little break and get back to MT101, and then touch on some CH101 and call it a night.

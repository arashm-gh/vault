- Atomic Mass unit from Mass Spectrometer
- Used to detect unknown elements as well
- We use a graph to map everything on the Mass Spectrometer
- How is it able to detect different isotopes?
	- Vaporization $\to$ Ionization $\to$ Acceleration $\to$ Deflection $\to$ Detection
	- ![[Mass Spectrometer Diagram - Textbook.png]]
	- Inject point (where sample enters, must be in vapor form)
	- We have to create a vacuum before putting in the sample
	- We have an electron gun at the front that shoots electrons at high velocity
	- The electrons and the positive ion charge cause the sample to accelerate
	- The sample can only pass through a small slit - used to turn them into one single continuous beam
	- The beam goes through a magnetic field which we can adjust the strength of to deflect the field
	- There's another slit at the end after the beam gets deflected
	- When the deflected beam goes through the final detector it creates a graph
	- The detector detects the intensity of what is hitting it
- AMU scale divided into 12 parts and is in respect to the carbon atom
- Mass of particle $\propto$ 1/Deflection (of particle)
- Chlorine is 35.5 AMU because of Isotopic Abundance
- There are 4 possible outcomes when we place a sample of Chlorine gas into the Mass Spectrometer
- $[ ^{35}Cl ^{35}Cl]^+$ and $[ ^{37}Cl ^{35}Cl]^+$ and $[ ^{37}Cl ^{37}Cl]^+$
- $^{35}Cl^+$ and $^{37}Cl^+$

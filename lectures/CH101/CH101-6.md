1. Chemical Formulas
2. Molecular Formula $\coloneqq$ shows the actual whole number ratio and structure of atoms in a molecule $\hookrightarrow$ $C_6H_{12}O_6$
3. Empirical Formula $\coloneqq$ Shows the simplest whole number ratio between elements in a compound $\hookrightarrow$ $CH_2O$
4. How are these formulas derived?

- Fire Safety
- Humanity's first great technological leap
- Fire is a good servant but a bad master
- Fire is an exothermic combustion reaction that releases large amount of heat, smoke, and light as the main products of combustion.
- Consequences of Fire
	- Death, Personal Loss
	- Global Warming
	- Biodiversity
	- Water Contamination
	- Property Damage
	- Smoke has Hydrogen Cyanide and Carbon Monoxide
- Common Causes of Fire
	- Carelessness
		- Poor Disposal
		- Handling of Substances
	- Accidental
		- Short circuits
		- Faulty Appliances or Fuels
		- Misuse of equipment
	- Ignorance
		- Inadequate fire prevention knowledge
	- Sabotage
		- Arson
- Top 10 Causes
	- 30.8% Cooking
	- 26.6% Grass and Forest
	- 11.9% Heating
	- 7.4% Child Play
	- 4.4% Electrical & Lighting
	- 4.4% Lightening
	- 5.7% Intentional

- Fire Diamond
	- Top Red: Flammability
	- Right Yellow: Instability
	- Left Blue: Health Hazard
	- Bottom White: Special Note
	- Flash Point: Temp at which air becomes flammable
- 70 questions and 80 questions 
- Fire Triangle (Old School methodology)
	- Fuel $\Leftrightarrow$ Ignition $\Leftrightarrow$ Oxygen
- Fire Tetrahedron
	- Heat $\Leftrightarrow$ Fuel $\Leftrightarrow$ Oxygen $\Leftrightarrow$ Chemical Chain Reaction
	- Cool $\Leftrightarrow$ Remove Fuel Source $\Leftrightarrow$ Smother Supply $\Leftrightarrow$ Interrupt
- Etiological Argument, Ontological Argument, Cosmological Argument
- Stages of Fire Development
	- Incipient: First Stage
	- Growth: Fire grows fast or slow
	- Flash-over: Transitional stage Created by Thermal Instability
	- Fully: Maximum Potential
	- Developed: Fully Developed stage
	- Decay: Fuel and Oxygen decay
- Principles of Heat Transmission and Fire Spread
	- Direct Burning
	- Ignition Temperature
	- Conduction needs a medium
	- Convention needs a medium
	- Radiation electromagnetic waves needs no medium
- You have 3 minutes to leave a building once a fire starts
- Principles of Fire Extinction
	- Cooling
	- Smothering: Fire Blankets and Water
	- Starvation
	- Break Chain Reaction
- Fire Prevention System
	- Active Fire Protection
		- Fire Suppression: Stand Pipes, Fire Extinguisher, Hydrant 
		- Sprinkler: Quick Response, Standard Response
		- Fire Detector: Smoke Detector, Heat Detector, Fire Alarm
		- Hypoxic (Hypo-Oxygen) Air Fire Prevention: Nitrogen/Carbon Dioxide Gas Fire Suppression System
	- Passive Fire Protection
		- Fire Resistance Rated Walls/Doors
		- Firewall
		- Fire-resistant glass
		- Fire-resistance rated floors
		- Occupancy Separations
	- General Fire Prevention
		- Be fire safety aware
		- Use electrical good equipment
		- Control ignition sources
		- Proper Storage of Fuels (Red, Blue, Yellow, Green)
		- Blocking Fire Exits
		- Good House Keeping
- Evacuation Procedure
	- Call Security 62333 (AcB) or 2333 
	- Do not delay your escape but try to close doors and turn off equipment
	- Internal Doors are cool
	- No lifts
	- Keep low to the floor
	- Leave the building immediately
	- Go to the Assembly Area
- Courage is not the absence of fear but the realization that there is something more important than fear.

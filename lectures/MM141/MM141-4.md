- Casting of metal into different shapes
- Copper has range of temperatures
- Fractures and errors can occur if care is not put during
- Segregation of Phases in case of alloys
- Defects
	- Misrun
		- Metal solidifies prematurely
		- Low pouring temp
		- Thin casting sections
		- Improper gating system
		- Insufficient fluidity
	- Cold Shots
		- Premature solidification of metal drops
		- Caused due to metal splattering
	- Hot tearing
		- Shrinkage during the cooling process can tear the metal

- Revision of the [[Coordinate System]] from [[MM101-4&5]] from before.
- Make sure to [[Normalize]] every [[Direction Vector]] donated with []
- How to draw [[Plane|Planes]]
	- Numbers in the brackets are called [[Miller Indices]]
	- All numbers are reciprocated
		- $$f(n) = \begin{cases} 0, \infty \\ x, \frac{1}{x} \end{cases}$$
	- Donated with ()
	- All Non-zero indices give us a [[Triangular Geometry]] for the plane
	- 2 Non-zero indices gives us a [[Rectangular Geometry]] for the plane 
	- Join all the points using lines after plotting them
- How to find the [[Miller Indices]] of a Plane
	- Triangular plane must have 3 integers
		- We must pick an origin that is touching a corner of the triangle but is not touching the plane
		- All axis must be touching the triangle from that side when picking the origin
	- Rectangular plane must have 2 integers
		- Origin must be touching the plane at 2 points minimum
	- Square plane must have 1 integer
	- [[Reciprocal|Reciprocate]] all Non-zero numbers

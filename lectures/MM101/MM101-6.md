- Substitute sir is insufferable
- SC = 1 atom, BCC = 2 atoms, FCC = 4 atoms.
- Unit Cell $\to$ Smallest repeating pattern of atoms. 
- Lattice $\to$ Geometric Structure
- Silicon is produced in the form of Ingots.
	- It is cut into wafers
- Materials have Geometry and Structure
- Crystallographic Directions = Vector coordinate system
- Edge = Line where two faces meet
- Use square brackets to define direction
- Use parenthesis to define planes
- The negative direction is defined using a bar: $[0\,\bar{1}\,0]$ is $0,-1,0$
- Always position the vector from the origin, translate the point of origin if necessary
- Same magnitude, Different direction is called a family of directions: define with $<1\,0\,0>$

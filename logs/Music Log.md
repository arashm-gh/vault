#Diary #Music 
> Before I start this log I would like anyone reading this to understand that obviously I have listened to a lot of music before I started making this! I might forget to add a lot of stuff but regardless I'm going to try my best from now.
> Format for this log is going to be: `{Artist}/{Album}/{Song} ({Release Year}) - {First Listen}`
> I'm only going to log albums I listen to while paying **full** attention to them.

> [!info] From Wikipedia and will be changed up
During a routine shipment, the Pony Express freighter spaceship Tulpar is sabotaged and crashed into an asteroid. Though the crew—captain Curly, co-pilot Jimmy, medic Anya, mechanic Swansea, and last-minute intern Daisuke—survive, most of the ship's resources are blocked off by airbag-like foam, damage to which could potentially breach the ship's hull and trigger lethal decompression. Curly, unable to speak or move after being severely mutilated by the crash, is kept sedated via a dwindling supply of painkillers. Jimmy declares himself acting captain as a result, and accuses Curly of going postal and causing the crash.
When food and medical supplies begin to run low after two months, the crew decide to open their confidential shipment, but discover that it consists solely of mouthwash. Swansea, a recovered alcoholic, decides to break his sobriety and consumes the mouthwash for its alcohol content, his intoxication increasing tensions further. Jimmy, who has been feeding Curly his pills as Anya continually cannot bring herself to do so, attacks and force feeds Curly in a rage before hallucinating killing him with an axe.
Four months after the crash, Anya locks herself in the medical bay with Curly. After failing to convince a drunken Swansea to let them into the utility bay, Jimmy and Daisuke serve him a tainted mocktail using the ship's sole bottle of rubbing alcohol. With Swansea rendered unconscious, Jimmy and Daisuke discover that Swansea was guarding the ship's only working cryopod, which Jimmy believes he was saving for himself. Jimmy then coerces Daisuke to crawl through a damaged vent into the medical bay. Daisuke makes it through, but is severely injured in the process. With the rubbing alcohol gone, Jimmy uses the mouthwash as an impromptu antiseptic, but it only worsens Daisuke's pain. Swansea, having come to care for Daisuke, reluctantly and crudely euthanizes him with a fire axe. Jimmy goes into the medical bay and encounters the corpse of Anya, who has committed suicide by overdosing on the remaining supply of painkillers. Jimmy finds the ship's emergency revolver and then hallucinates being attacked by a vengeful Swansea.
Flashbacks to the days leading up to the crash reveal that the Tulpar crew were due to be laid off following their delivery due to Pony Express going out of business. At his birthday party, Curly breaks the news prematurely and reveals that he has been recommended for a better job. Later, Anya reveals to Curly that she is pregnant with Jimmy's child as a result of what is implied to be rape. Curly attempts to ease tensions with Jimmy, only for Anya to reveal her pregnancy to him behind Curly's back. Curly confronts Jimmy and urges him to take responsibility for his actions. Jimmy warns him that if word gets out about what he did to Anya, Curly will be held accountable for it as well, leading to Curly letting Jimmy go. The stress of his impending layoff, his jealousy toward Curly, and the threat of being held accountable for Anya's pregnancy ultimately drove Jimmy to crash the Tulpar in a failed murder–suicide bid, with Curly acquiring his injuries attempting to prevent the crash.
Jimmy begins to hallucinate that the ship is a maze, finding himself in a graveyard where he is hunted down by Swansea. Jimmy manages to subdue Swansea, who confesses that the years he spent addicted to alcohol were the best of his life and implies that the cryopod was actually intended for Daisuke before condemning Jimmy for his selfishness and cowardice. Jimmy fatally shoots Swansea with the revolver. His sanity rapidly declining, Jimmy holds a mock birthday party with the crew's corpses. He cuts off and consumes part of Curly's leg, then force-feeds the captain his own flesh in a surreal hallucination. Jimmy hallucinates himself justifying his actions and apologising to a burning Curly. After a series of visions where he is chased by a deformed mass of horse statues, Jimmy finds himself confronted by the Pony Express mascot Polle, who mocks him for his inability to take accountability for his faults. Jimmy concludes that he can redeem himself if he ensures Curly's survival, and places him in the cryopod. He apologizes to Curly for everything before killing himself with the revolver. The game's credits roll as Curly is placed into a 20-year cryosleep, his fate left uncertain. 
# Reception
1. [[Narrative Structure]] received praise
	1. The opening, which puts the player in control while the viewpoint character crashes the Tulpar, was praised by critics
	2. [[Bloody Disgusting]] and [[Rock Paper Shotgun]] for creating an immediate sense of tension and prompting curiosity about what has just happened.
	3. Writing for Paste, [[Elijah Gonzalez]] felt that the game's nonlinear narrative enhanced the sense of intrigue by driving speculation on preceding events.
	4. [[Leon Hurley]] of [[GamesRadar+]] felt that the use of a [[Nonlinear Narrative]] and [[Unreliable Narrator]] created an air of mystery and kept the player uncertain about the true nature of events.
	5. The [[Nonlinear Narrative]] was also praised for adding depth to the cast of characters by revealing different aspects of their personalities, and for immersing the player in the setting of the Tulpar.
	6. [[Lucy Buglass]] of [[TechRadar]] described the game as "constantly compelling"
	7. [[Stephanie Liu]] of [[Siliconera]] called it "a master class in how you can push video game writing to its limits.
2. The [[Graphics]] and [[Visual Style]] were also received well.
	1. [[Aaron Boehm]] of [[Bloody Disgusting]] labelled the [[Low-Poly Graphics]] as "beautiful",
	2. [[Elijah Gonzalez]] of Paste said they "invite us to imagine the finer details for ourselves".
	3. [[Leon Hurley]] of [[GamesRadar+]] wrote that "[[Mouthwashing|Mouthwashing's]] low poly horror stylings hide a [[Triple A]] [[Art Direction]]".[33]
	4. [[Keith Stuart]] of [[The Guardian]] praised the game's visual style for its ability to generate unease in the player, comparing it to the work of [[Surrealist Filmmakers]] [[David Lynch]] and [[Dario Argento]].[29]
	5. Writing for [[Hardcore Gamer]], [[Kyle LeClair]] likened the graphics to [[Fifth Generation Video Game Consoles]], arguing that they complement the Tulpar's retro style.[27]
	6. This comparison to fifth generation titles, particularly those of the original [[PlayStation (console)]]
	7. [[Harold Goldberg]] of [[The New York Times]]
    8. [[Ronny Barrier]] of [[IGN]]

    10. [[Oisin Kuhnke]] of [[VG247]]
3. A number of outlets, including [[GamesRadar+]], [[Rock Paper Shotgun]], and [[Bloody Disgusting]], called aspects of the game "[[Cinematic]]", including its [[Framing]] of shots and the glitchy [[Transitions]] between [[Scenes]]. 
	1. [[Katy Hanson]] of [[Rely on Horror]] felt the transitions disrupted the flow of the game.
4. The [[Setting]] was generally well received.
	  1. Writing for [[Eurogamer]], [[Katharine Castle]] praised the developers for making "wonderful use of its small and intimate setting".[26]
	  2. [[Ed Thorn]] of [[Rock Paper Shotgun]] called the Tulpar a "brilliantly realised space", citing the game's use of twisting, narrow corridors, but argued that certain scenes tended towards "surrealist tunnel meandering".[32]
	  3. In contrast, critics for [[Bloody Disgusting]] and [[Rely on Horror]] felt that the small, cramped setting at the beginning of the game set up the transition to hallucinatory shifting hallways well.
	  4. [[Ted Litchfield]] of [[PC Gamer]] called the Tulpar a "fantastic setting" and noted the inclusion of "great character details" left throughout the ship such as notes, pamphlets, and half-finished boardgames.[7]
	  5. [[Kyle LeClair]] of [[Hardcore Gamer]] arguing that the limited number of locations made the game unpleasantly repetitive.[27]
5. Critics enjoyed the cast of characters.
	  1. [[Kyle LeClair]] of [[Hardcore Gamer]] felt the characters had "nice and colorful personalities",
	  2. [[Katy Hanson]] of [[Rely on Horror]] found them "charming and memorable".
	  3. Writing for [[PC Gamer]], [[Ted Litchfield]] considered the horror to be built upon human drama, featuring themes of "[[Failed Ambitions]], [[Resentments]], and [[Regrets]] of people forced to work a [[Dead-End Job]]".
	  4. Critics for [[Paste]] and [[VG247]] similarly identified [[Satire]] and {[Black Comedy]} in the game's treatment of [[Corporate Greed]], which enhanced the [[Horror]] and gave depth to the Characters' motivations,
	  5. [[Elijah Gonzalez]] of [[Paste]] felt that Anya was less well-developed as a character, which he thought "squares awkwardly with the fact she's constantly catching [[Verbal Abuse]] from her male [[Co-Workers]]".
6. Critics were more mixed on the game's [[Puzzle|Puzzles]] and [[Combat]] and [[Stealth]] gameplay sections.
	  1. [[Ed Thorn]] of [[Rock Paper Shotgun]] described the gameplay as "simple, but wonderfully tactile"
	  2. [[Ted Litchfield]] of [[PC Gamer]] felt that the tactile nature of the [[Minigames]] and their juxtaposition of food and human flesh made for compelling [[Body Horror]].
	  3. [[Stephanie Liu]] of [[Siliconera]] called the [[Combat]] and [[Stealth]] sections "unnecessary and clunky".
	  4. [[Ronny Barrier]] of [[IGN]] found the [[Survival Horror]] and [[Combat]] segments "frustrating", though brief enough so as not to hamper his enjoyment.
	  5. [[Katy Hanson]] of [[Rely on Horror]] thought the puzzles were too simple, which made them "feel like busywork"
	  6. [[Kyle LeClair]] of [[Hardcore Gamer]] felt the "annoying chase bits" and "non-challenging puzzles" were not enough to justify [[Mouthwashing]] being a videogame rather than a [[Visual Novel]].[27]
  7. Game Design
	  1. [[Aaron Boehm]], writing for [[Bloody Disgusting]], argued to the contrary, claiming that the gameplay "always complements the [[Narrative]] and mood of the game in a way that justifies it being an interactive piece of media".[3]
	  2. Reviews in [[Bloody Disgusting]] and [[Rely on Horror]] praised the game's subversion of [[Traditional Video Game Mechanics]], such as its use of [[Onscreen Objectives]] to build suspense,[2][3]
	  3. [[Keith Stuart]] of [[The Guardian]] felt the game was "a study of what games are and what they want us to do".[29]

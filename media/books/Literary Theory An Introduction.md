## Introduction
- "Art as Device" by Viktor Shklovsky
- > *This book sets out to provide a reasonably comprehensive account of modern literary theory for those with little or no previous knowledge of the topic.*
- What is *Literature*?
- > *Seventeenth-century English literature includes [[Shakespeare]], [[Webster]], [[Marvell and Milton]]; but it also stretches to the essays of [[Francis Bacon]], the sermons of [[John Donne]], [[Bunyan]]'s spiritual autobiography and whatever it was that [[Sir Thomas Browne]] wrote. It might even at a pinch be taken to encompass [[Hobbes]]'s Leviathan or [[Clarendon]]'s History of the Rebellion.*
- > *French seventeenth-century literature contains, along with [[Corneille and Racine]], [[La Rochefoucauld]]'s maxims, [[Bossuet]]'s funeral speeches, [[Boileau]]'s treatise on poetry, [[Madame de Sevigne]]'s letters to her daughter and the philosophy of [[Rene Descartes|Descartes]] and [[Pascal]].*
- > *Nineteenth-century English literature usually includes [[Lamb]] (though not [[Bentham]]), [[Macaulay]] (but not [[Marx]]), [[Mill]] (but not [[Darwin]] or [[Herbert Spencer]]).*
- > *[Literature] in the words of the Russian critic Roman [[Jakobson]], represents an 'organized violence committed on ordinary speech'.*
- > *Literature transforms and intensifies ordinary language, deviates systematically from everyday speech.*
- > *There is a disproportion between the signifiers and the signifieds.*
	  Signifiers $\coloneqq$ A sign's physical form (such as a sound, printed word, or image) as distinct from its meaning.
	  Signifieds $\coloneqq$ The meaning or idea expressed by a sign, as distinct from the physical form in which it is expressed. 
- > *This, in effect, was the definition of the 'literary' advanced by the Russian formalists, who included in their ranks [[Viktor Shklovsky]], [[Roman Jakobson]], [[Osip Brik]], [[Yury Tynyanov]], [[Boris Eichenbaum]] and [[Boris Tomashevsky]].*
- > *Criticism should dissociate art from mystery and concern itself with how literary texts actually worked: literature was not pseudo-religion or psychology or sociology but a particular organization of language.  It had its own specific laws, structures and devices, which were to be studied in themselves rather than reduced to something else.*
- [[Pushkin]]'s Eugene Onegin
- > *Animal Farm for the Formalists would not be an allegory of Stalinism; on the contrary, Stalinism would simply provide a useful opportunity for the construction of an allegory.*
- > *The Formalists started out by seeing the literary work as a more or less arbitrary assemblage of 'devices', and only later came to see these devices as interrelated elements or 'functions' within a total textual system. 'Devices' included sound, imagery, rhythm, syntax, metre, rhyme, narrative techniques, in fact the whole stock of formal literary elements; and what all of these elements had in common was their 'estranging' or 'defamiliarizing' effect.*
- > *Most of the time we breathe in air without being conscious of it: like language, it is the very medium in which we move. But if the air is suddenly thickened or infected we are forced to attend to our breathing with new vigilance, and the effect of this may be a heightened experience of our bodily life. We read a scribbled note from a friend without paying much attention to its narrative structure; but if a story breaks off and begins again, switches constantly from one narrative level to another and delays its climax to keep us in suspense, we become freshly conscious of how it is constructed at the same time as our engagement with it may be intensified.*
-  [[Laurence Sterne]]'s Tristram Shandy
-  [[Knut Hamsun]]'s Hunger
- > *Literature, then, we might say, is 'non-pragmatic' discourse: unlike biology textbooks and notes to the milkman it serves no immediate practical purpose, but is to be taken as referring to a general state of affairs.*
- > *Some texts are born literary, some achieve literariness, and some have literariness thrust upon them.*
- > *...one can think of literature less as some inherent quality or set of qualities displayed by certain kinds of writing all the way from Beowulf to Virginia Woolf, than as a number of ways in which people relate themselves to writing.*
- > *John M. Ellis has argued that the term 'literature' operates rather like the word 'weed': weeds are not particular kinds of plant, but just any kind of plant which for some reason or another a gardener does not what around.*
- > *As the philosophers might say, 'literature' and 'weed' are functional rather than ontological terms...*
- > *Any belief that the study of literature is the study of a stable, well-definable entity, as entomology is the study of insects, can be abandoned as a chimera.*
- > *What we have uncovered so far, then, is not only that literature does not exist in the sense that insects do, and that the value-judgements by which it is constituted are historically variable, but that these value-judgements themselves have a close relation to social ideologies.*
## The Rise of English
- > *writing which embodied thevalues and 'tastes' of a particular social class qualified as literature, whereas a street ballad, a popular romance and perhaps even the drama did not.*

So the book starts of with a bunch of [[Rene Descartes|Descartes]].
It talks about **[[Cogito, ergo sum]]** and the **[[Thought Demon]]**.
He also mentions how [[Rene Descartes|Descartes]] was a [[Catholic]]! Which I didn't know!!
It then talks about the weaknesses of Descartes' arguments.
And then it briefly mentions [[Nietzsche]] and another [[German]] guy.
Then it talks about Cogito some more than goes into [[Rationalism]] and [[Bertrand Russel]].

In this current reading, I'm already kind of tired so not much makes sense :(

#Lecture
- Python: Comments, Expressions, Input/Output, Variables, Arithmetic Operations.
- Comment $\to$ 
	- Used to explain code
	- Make code readabe
	- Prevent execution
	- Start with `#` and the line is ignored by python.
	- `# This is a comment`
	  `print("Hello World!")`
- Variable
	- A named piece of memory that can store a value
	- `name = value`
	- e.g.: `x = 40`, `gpa = 3.12`, `first_name = "Arash"`
- Memory Concepts
	- Variable Names correspond to locations in the computer's memory
	- Storing of new value overrides the previous value:
	  `x = 5`
	  `x = 7`
	  `print(x) # x will now be 7`
	- Reading values does not change them
- Naming Variables
	- Must begin with a letter or an underscore
	- Cannot start with a number
	- Cannot have special characters
	- Cannot be keywords
	- Should be descriptive
	- Long names are discouraged
	- `totalMarks` instead of `t` or `totalNumberOfMarksForStudents`
- Outputting
	- `print("hello")` will output
	- `print("hello ", "world")` and `print("hello" + "world")`
- Data Types
	- Python is Dynamically Typed (Assigns the data type automatically)
	- Numeric Data
		- Integers (whole numbers)
		  `x : int = 0`
		- Floating point (decimal numbers)
		  `x : float = 1.0`
	- Text Data
		- String
		  `x : str = "hi"`
	- True/False
		- Boolean
		  `x : bool = True`
- Find the output for the following
  `firstName = "John"`
  `lastName = "Doe"`
  `question = "5+5"`
  `print(lastName, ",", firstname, ";", question)`

#Lecture
- Python Programming
	- Cleaner syntax, Indentation matters
	- No type declaration
	- Interpreted language
	- Lots of libraries
	- Large community
	- Garbage Collection
- Fetching Memory stored in the Hard-drive is very slow whereas the CPU is very slow
- Fetch Speed $\propto$ 1/Size:
	- Register $\to$ Cache $\to$ RAM $\to$ Drive
- Volatile Memory: Register, Cache, Ram
- Nonvolatile Memory: HDD, SSD, ROM
- Cache and Registers are part of the CPU
- `print("hello cs101 d")`
- order of operations:
	- Parenthesis ()
	- Multiplication, Division, and Modulo
	- Addition and Subtraction
	- The order followed is left to right, e.g.: `print(5+2-7)` outputs `10`

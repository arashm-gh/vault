1. Formula for mean: Mean = (sum) / (number of numbers)
```python
sum = 0
for x in range(0, 5, 1):
	num = int(input("Enter number: "))
	sum = sum + num
print(f"Mean: {add/5}")
```

2. Is there a better way to do this?
	1. Break big problems into smaller problems
	2. Building blocks of code bases
	3. Functions are like short programs
```python
def func():
	return None
```
3. Defined using the `def` keyword, Parameters are inputs to the function `()` in the parenthesis, `return` is the keyword for output from a function
4. Functions have scope where things defined in the functions cannot be used outside the function
```python
def print_numbers(n):
	for i in range(1,i+1):
		print(i)

print_numbers(5) # Will output 1-5
```

- Algorithm: An algorithm is a step by step procedure or formula for solving problems. They are the foundation of computer programming.
- Good algorithms make use of:
	- Efficiency: Uses the least amount of resources to give the maximum output   
	- Clarity: Each step should be clearly defined and unambiguous
	- Finiteness: Must always terminate after a finite number of steps
- Al-Khwarizami Principal: *All complex problems can be broken down into simpler sub-problems.* Then We solve the smaller sub-problems in order one at a time.
- Computer is not intelligent but it is a powerful tool.
- We must tell the computer what do to to solve our problems. The instructions we give are called Computer Programming.
- Programmers can program for platform: Desktop Apps, Web Apps, Mobile Apps, Database Apps, Game Development, etc.
- Logic:
	- Login in programming refers to the flow of control within a program based off of certain conditions.
	- Logic allows a program to make decisions based off of conditions.
	  e.g.: If temperature $\geq30$ degrees then turn the AC on. 
	- Structures like loops help in executing repeated actions.
	  e.g.: Print numbers 1 to 1000
- Flow Chart: Visual representation of a set of instructions/a program.
	- Oval: Start and End points.
	- Rectangle: Process, action, or step.
	- Diamond: Decision point with branches.
	- Parallelogram: Input or Output
	- Arrow: Shows the direction of flow from one step to another.

- Pseudocode is a way to describe an algorithm using plain language. It acts as the middleman between natural language and programming languages.
- `Start`
  `Input 5 Numbers: A,B,C,D, and E.`
  `Sum = A + B + C + D + E`
  `Avg = Sum / 5`
  `Ouput Avg`
  `End`
- High Level Language: Closer to human language, computers can understand
- Low Level Language: Closer to computer language

#Lecture 
1. Nested loop is putting a loop inside another loop
```python
for i in range([outer_range]):
	for j in range([inner_range]):
		[code block]
```
2. Code runs for `outer_range*inner_range` iterations
3. Print the table of 5
```python
for x in range(10):
	print(f"{i+1} * 5 = {(i+1)*5}")
```
OR
```python
for x in range(1,11):
	print(f"{i} * 5 = {i*5}")
```
4. Print the tables from 1 to 6
```python
for mult in range(1,7):
	for i in range(1,11):
		print(f"{i} * {mult} = {i*mult}")
```
5. While loop
```python
i = 1
while <= 5:
	print(i)
	i+=1
```
6. Keep asking numbers until they input 0 and sum them up
```python
sum = 0
while (n := int(input("Enter a number"))) != 0:
	sum += n
print(sum)
```

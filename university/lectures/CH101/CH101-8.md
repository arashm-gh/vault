1. Quiz average marks were $12.8$ out of $20$
2. Q1) In a lab experiment a beaker loses $120 mg$ of heavy water ($D_2O$) due to evaporation over a period of 1 hour and 30 minutes. How many deuterium atoms per second evaporated?
	1. (Atomic Masses: D = $2 amu$, O = $16 amu$)
	2. $\Rightarrow 1.338\times 10^{18} \frac{D\,atoms}{s}$
3. Q2) You are sitting in an exam hall and feeling hungry. Out of nervousness you consume a candy with $0.005kg$ of glucose ($C_6H_{12}O_6$) hidden in your pocket. Calculate how many atoms of hydrogen you consumed.
	1. (Atomic Masses: $C = 12 amu$, $H = 1amu$, $O = 16amu$)
	2. $\Rightarrow 2.007 \times 10^{23} H\,atoms$
4. T1) $M_2O_3$ is $1.020g$, $gM = 0.540$
	1. $?Og = 1.020 - 0.540 = 0.480 gO$
	2. $?mol M = 0.480gO \times \frac{1molO}{16gO} \times \frac{2 mol M}{3 mol O} = 0.02molM$
	3. $0.540gM \frac{1}{0.02mol M} = 27$
	4. [[Aluminum]]!
5. Calculations: Grams, Moles, Molecules
	1. $2H_2 + O_2 \to 2H_2O$

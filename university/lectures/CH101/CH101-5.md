#Lecture
- First class of week 3!
- First quiz is in the next week (4th)
- Syllabus is everything covered till then (Chapter 1-4 of the book)
- Revision of the bridge method of conversion
- Conversion Sequence:
	- Grams $\leftrightarrow$ Moles $\leftrightarrow$ Atoms/Molecules
	- How many moles of atoms does $136.9g$ of iron contain?
	  $Am \, of \, Iron: 26.$
	  $136.9g \, Fe \times \frac{1\,mol\,Fe}{55.85g\,Fe} = 2.45\,mol \, Fe \, atoms$
	- Values will be part of the question statement
	- How many atoms are in $2.451 \, mol$
	  $2.451 \, mol \times \frac{6.022 \times 10^{23} \,Fe\,Atoms}{1\,mol\,Fe\,Atoms} = 1.476 \times 10^{24}\,Fe\,Atoms.$
	- How many atoms are there in $13.5g$ of aluminum?
	  $13.5g \times \frac{1\,mol}{26.98\,g\,/mol} \times \frac{6.022 \times 10^{23}\,Al\,Atoms}{1\,mol} = 3.01\times10^{23}\,Al\,atoms.$
- New Problem
	- Suppose $0.05g$ of water evaporates in one hour. How many molecules evaporate in one second?
	  $0.05\,\frac{g\,H_2O}{h} \times \frac{1\,mol\,H_2O}{18\,g/mol} \times \frac{6.022\times10^{23}\,H_2O\,Atoms}{1\,mol} \times \frac{1h}{60min} \times \frac{1min}{60s} = 4.646\times10^{17}\,H_2O\,Atoms/s.$
	- A stack of $500$ sheets of paper is $1.9$ inches thick. Calculate the thickness, in inches, and in miles, of a stack of paper that contains one mole ($6.022 \times 10^{23}$) of sheets.
	  Thickness of 1 paper in inches:
	  $\frac{1.9\,inch}{500\,sheets} \times \frac{6.022\times10^{23} sheets}{1} \times \frac{1\,foot}{12\,inch} \times \frac{1\,mile}{5280\,inch} = 3.6\times10^{16}\,miles.$
	- That many sheets would go from the earth to the sun $107,526,881$ times.

#Lecture 
1. Make-up class for Monday
2. [[Bridge Method]] must be done in one line or you will lose 20% marks in quiz
3. $3Na_{(s)} + P_{(s)} \to Na_3P_{(s)}$
	1. $10g$ of [[Sodium]] given, how many grams of [[Sodium Phosphate]]?
	2. $?g\,Na_3P_{(s)} = 10g\,Na \times \frac{1mol\,Na}{23g\,Na} \times \frac{1mol\,Na_3P}{3mol\,Na} \times \frac{100g\,Na_3P}{1mol\,Na_3P}$
4. Calculate molecules of $P$ for $14.5g Na_3P$
	1. $?atoms\,P = 14.5g\,Na_3P \times \frac{1mol\,Na_3P}{100g\,Na_3P} \times \frac{1mol\,Na_3P}{1mol\,P} \times \frac{6.022atoms\,P}{1mol\,P} = 8.7319\times10^{22}$
5. Limiting and Excess Reagent
	1. Limiting Reactant = The reactant is the one that is consumed first in a reaction OR the reagent that produces the least amount of moles of product
	2. Excess Reactant = The unreacted left over reagent after the limiting reagent is used up
6. 7 moles of [[Oxygen]] and 10 moles of [[Hydrogen]]
	1. $?mol\,H_20 = 10mol\,H_2 \times \frac{2mol\,H_2O}{2mol\,H_2} = 10mol\,H_2O$
	2. $?mol\,H_20 = 7mol\,O_2 \times \frac{2mol\,H_2O}{1mol\,O_2} = 14mol\,H_2O$
	3. [[Hydrogen]] is the limiting reagent
	4. [[Oxygen]] is the excess reagent
7. Phosphorus the Limiting Element
	1. [[Carbon]], [[Hydrogen]], [[Nitrogen]], [[Sulfur]], and [[Phosphorus]] are responsible for plant growth. [[Phosphorus]] was the limiting reagent. What if excess [[Phosphorus]] is added in large quantities from [[Detergents]] and [[Fertilizers]] into [[River|Rivers]], [[Pond|Ponds]], and [[Creek|Creeks]]?
	2. [[Photoeuriphication]]

#Lecture
- Mass Spectrometer and measurements of atomic masses
- Class Rules to be followed from next week:
	- Fill Front first
	- 10 minutes late
- Mass Spectrometer $\to$ Used to identify Materials
- Stoichiometry
- We need engines with:
	- Compacter
	- Lighter in weight
	- Higher Charge Storage Capacity
- Applied Chem:1+6+1+1+6 lectures
- **Suitability is a buzzword?**
- Quantification is majorly done with Number or Weight
- Chemistry is a quantitative science (*in this course*) dealing with:
	- Chemical Species $\to$ Number & Mass
		- Atoms, Molecules, Ions, Free Radicals (*species with unpaired electrons*)
	- Balanced Chemical Equations $\to$ Number
	- Amount of Substance
		- Molecules, Mass, Moles
- Odd Number of Total Electrons: $H$ $OH$ $OOH$ $NO$ $NO _2$ $NO _3$
- Free Radicals have very important reactions: $OH + CO \to CO _2 + H$ $\to$ Major Advantages to this reaction but also Disadvantages (Global Warming) 
- $OH$ is the detergent of the atmosphere and the vacuum cleaner of the atmosphere
- Mass Spectrometer used to measure the atomic mass of different isotopes and elements relative to the Carbon-12 atom.
- $X^A_N$
- Why was Carbon-12 used as the base?
	- Different elements were used in different periods.
		- Hydrogen was used because it is light
		- Oxygen was chosen for it's high ranges of combinations with elements.
		- Oxygen stopped being used because it has many isotopes in nature and that prevents it from being reliable.
- Atomic Mass Unit
- Next Lesson $\to$ Working and Usage of Mass Spectrometer

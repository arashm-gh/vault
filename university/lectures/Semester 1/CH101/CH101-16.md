6. [[Lithium Ion Battery]] most common
7. Propose a battery that uses the [[Standard Reduction Potential]] and is:
	1. Light (Low Weight)
	2. Carries High Charge
	3. Small in Size (Low Volume)
# Lesson
1. Voltage Depends on Concentration
2. Five step procedure for evaluating the standard cell potential at:
	1. $25C$
	2. $1atm$
	3. $1M$ (Molar) concentration
3. Nonstandard Cell Potential
	1. Nonstandard conditions
4. We will only be changing concentration
	1. Other things out of syllabus
5. [[NERNST Equation]]
	1. Must be memorized
6. Example
	1. $Zn(s)|ZnSO_4(aq)||CuSO_4(aq)|Cu(s)$
	2. $Zn(s) + Cu^{2-}(aq) \rightleftharpoons Cu(s) + Zn^{2+}(aq)$
	3. $Q = \frac{[Zn^{2+}(aq)^{1}]\times[1]}{1\times[Cu^{2+}(aq)]^1}$
	4. When concentration of [[Copper]] is increased, the Nonstandard Electric potential increases
	5. When concentration of [[Zinc]] is increased, the Nonstandard Electric potential decreases
7. Question 1
	1. $H_2(g) + 2AgCl(s) \rightleftharpoons 2Ag(s) + 2H^{+} +2Cl^{-}(aq)$
	2. Predict the effects when:
	3. $H_2(g)$ pressure is increased
	4. $H^+(aq)$ Concentration increased
	5. Increase in amount of $AgCl(s)$
	6. Partial Pressure and Concentration are directly proportional
		1. $PV = nRT \to \frac{n}{V} = \frac{P}{RT}$ 
		2. $C \propto P$
	7. $Q = \frac{[H^+(aq)]^2[Cl]^2}{-}$

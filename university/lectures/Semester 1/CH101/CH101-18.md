#Lecture 
1. Coal
	1. Coal $\to$ Coal Gasification $\to$ Syngas
		1. Ammonia Fertilizers, Methanol/DME/Propylene, Electricity
		2. [[Synthetic Natural Gas]], Hydrogen, Carbon Dioxide
		3. ([[Gas Turbine]], [[Steam Turbine]], [[Hydrogen Fuel Cell]])
	2. $\to$ Fischer Tropsch
		1. [[Diesel Fuel]]/[[Kerosine]]/Jet Fuel, [[Naptha]]/[[Gasoline]]/Detergents, Waxes/Lubricants, Steam/Electricity
	3. Coal is a Dirty Fuel
		1. Handling and Practice
		2. Coal has traces of
			1. [[Mfine inhalable particles, with diameters that are generally 2.5 micrometers and smallerercury]]
			2. [[Sulfur Oxides]]
			3. [[Nitrogen Oxides]]
			4. [[Carbon Oxides]]
	4. Upon burning produces Fly Ash and Particulate Matter
			1. $PM_{2.5} =$ fine inhalable particles, with diameters that are generally 2.5 micrometers and smaller
			2. $PM_{10} =$ inhalable particles, with diameters that are generally 10 micrometers and smaller; 
		1. Slag left as residue in the furnace
	5. [[Clean Coal Technology]]
		1. Precombustion
			1. 
		2. Postcombustion
		3. Integrated Gas Combine Cycle (IGCC)
			1. Coal gasified intro syn gas
			2. Burnt at high temperature
			3. Steam turns steam turbine
			4. Some Syngas is diverted for making useful chemicals
			5. IGCC is 60% eff whereas coal is 30%
2. Natural Gas
	1. Composition
		1. 85% [[Methane]], 9% [[Ethane]], 3% [[Propane]], 1% [[Butane]], 1% [[Nitrogen]], traces of $CO_2$, $H_2S$, moisture
		2. [[Monoethanolamine]], [[Diethanolamine]], [[Methyldiethanolamine]] = amine-based solvents
			1. Absorb $CO_2$, $H_2S$
		3. Odorant called [[Mercapton]] is added for leak detection
		4. Methane requires significant processing before use but is one of the cleanest-burning fossil fuels
	2. Natural Gas Purification
		1. Removal of Solid Impurities
			1. Dust, Sand, and other Particulates are removed using Filters or Mechanical Separators
		2. Removal of Acid Gases (Sweetening) 
			1. Acidic and Toxic Gases like $H_2S$ and $CO_2$ are removed using [[Diethanolamine]] and [[Methyldiethanolamine]] - Ionic Bond
		3. Moisture Removal/Dehydration
			1. [[Diethylene Glycol]] high affinity for water - Hydrogen Bond
		4. Removal of Heavy Hydrocarbons
			1. [[Ethane]], [[Propane]], and [[Butane]] are absorbed using [[Hexane]]
		5. [[Fractional Distillation]]
			1. Used to recover Hexane and separate hydrocarbons

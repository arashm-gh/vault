4. Question 1
	1. Calculate the mass of Copper in $g$ produced during the passage of $2.5$ amperes of current for $50.0$ minutes through a solution of [[Copper(II) Sulfate]]. $Cu^{2+}_{(aq)} + 2e^- \to Cu_{(s)}$
	2. [[Electrodeposition]] will occur
	3. $?gCu = (2.5A)(50min) \times \frac{60sec}{1min} \times \frac{1Cs^{-1}}{1A} \times \frac{1mole^-}{96500C} \times \frac{1molC}{2mole^-} \times \frac{63.5g}{1mol} = 2.47gCu$
5. Question 2
	1. What mass of silver could be plated onto a spoon from electrolysis of silver nitrate with a current of $2.78A$ for $45min$. $Ag^+_{(aq)} + 1e^- \to Ag_{(s)} = 8.4gAg$
	2. $?gAg = (2.78A)(45min) \times \frac{60sec}{1min} \times \frac{1Cs^{-1}}{1A} \times \frac{1mol\,e^-}{96500C} \times \frac{1molC}{1mol\,e^-} \times \frac{108gAg}{1mol} = 8.4g$

7. Pure [[Zinc]] rod in [[Zinc Sulfate]] 
	1. The rod starts getting consumed
	2. $Zn_{(s)} \to Zn^{2+}_{(aq)} + 2e^-$
	3. Electrons cannot swim so they stay on the rod
	4. The rod accumulates electrons and becomes negatively charged because it's losing Zinc

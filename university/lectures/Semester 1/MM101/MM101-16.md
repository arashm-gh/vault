#Lecture 
1. [[Definitions of Mechanical Properties of Materials]]
2. Mechanical Properties
3. Materials respond differently to different types of loads
	1. Nature of the applied load
	2. Duration of Load
	3. Environmental conditions
4. All these must be standardized
5. American Society for Testing and Materials ([[ASTM]])
6. $stress = \frac{force}{area}$
7. Torsion, Compression, Shear
8. Stress vs. Strength
	1. They have the same unit
	2. Strength relies on the structure of the material
	3. Stress is related to Load
9. Tensile Stress = Force Equal and Opposite, Bonds are elongated, Normal to the Surface
10. Sheer Stress = Along the Surface
11. Torsion = Opposite Forces on the same face, Rotational
12. Compression Stress = ???
13. Strain: $\epsilon = \frac{l-l_0}{l_0}$: Change in Length
14. Tensile Testing requires Dog Bone geometry
15. Load Cell: Applies force
16. Output of Testing: Stress vs. Strain: Fishing Rod shape of the graph as the center of the dog bone decreases in thickness
17. Yield Strength: Maximum Elastic, Minimum Plastic Deformation
18. Stress vs. Strain
	1. Stress is not constant while Strain is constant
	2. The Load sensor moves at a constant rate
	3. To keep the strain rate constant the forces must be decreased
	4. As the area at the neck is very low
	5. Neck has Microporosities
19. Ultimate Tensile Strength
20. Tensile Testing graph of Brittle vs Ductile Material

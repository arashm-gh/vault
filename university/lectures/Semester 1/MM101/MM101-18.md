#Lecture 
1. [[Definitions of Mechanical Properties of Materials]]
2. Elastic Deformation
	1. Effect of Temperature
	2. Ductile to Brittle Transformation
		1. Broke into two pieces
	3. Elastic Modulus Decreases as Temperature Increases
3. Plastic Deformation
	1. Yield Strength/Point
		1. Point at which noticeable plastic deformation occurs
		2. Resistance to Plastic Deformation: $\sigma_y$
	2. Metals have only one yield point after which material has Plastic Deformation
	3. Lower Yield Point
		1. Minimum strength/Minimum load to maintain plastic deformation
	4. Upper Yield Point
		1. Plastic Deformation starts
4. Tensile Stress - Strain
	1. Strain
	2. Elasticity Modulus = Slope of Curve
		1. $E = \frac{\Delta \sigma}{\Delta x}$
	3. Elastic Limit = Deformation is directly proportional with load
	4. Plastic 
	5. Yield Strength = Draw a parallel line to the Minimum plastic point
		1. $F = \sigma A_p = \sigma (\frac{d}{2})^2\pi$
	6. $\Delta l = l_0$
5. A piece of Copper originally is 305mm long. It is pulled in tension with a stress of 276 MPa. If the deformation is entirely elastic, what will be the resultant elongation? Elastic Modulus of Ca is 110 GPa.

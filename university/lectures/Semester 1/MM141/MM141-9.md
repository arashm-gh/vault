#Lecture 
1. Impact testing of Engineering Materials
2. [[Definitions of Mechanical Properties of Materials]]
3. [[Charpy Impact Test]]
	1. The sample is hit with a swinging hammer
	2. Bar length: 55mm, 10mm, 10mm, notch of 2mm
4. [[Izod Impact Testing]]
5. Charpy vs. Izod
	1. Both ends are fixed in charphy
	2. One is fixed in izod
	3. Hammer hits on opposite side of notch vs. on the same side
	4. Sample is hit in the middle, Sample is hit on the side
	5. Impact toughness
6. Ductile to Brittle Transition Temperature 
	1. All materials are below beyond a certain temperature
7. Cracks move through grains in brittle materials
	1. Fractures are clean
8. Cracks move along the grain boundaries in ductile materials
	1. Fractures are irregular

9. $Size \propto \frac{1}{Risk}$
10. Control of Substances Hazardous to Health Regulations
	1. Asses (The Risks)
		1. Task: More Energy, More Risk
		2. Work Area: More Enclosed a space, More Dust build up
		3. Time: The Longer the Work Takes, The most dust
		4. Frequency: Regularity increases Risks
	2. Control (The Risks)

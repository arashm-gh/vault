1. Integration started
2. Lesson given by T.A. Waseem Akram
3. Integration is the process of making an infinite number of rectangles with infinitesimal width that cover the area under the graph. As the width of the rectangles approach $0$ the number of rectangles approaches $\infty$ and the equation gives us a more accurate number for the area. 
4. Each addition of Rectangles reduces the error in the calculation.
5. Question 1
	1. $f(x) = sin(x)$
	2. Use 4 rectangles to approximate the area of $f$ from $[0,\pi]$
	3. $A = \frac{\pi}{4}+ sin(\frac{\pi}{4}+\frac{\pi}{4})+\dots$
	4. $A = 2.47$
6. The area becomes: $$A\approx\sum_{i} f(x_i)\Delta x$$
7. Which has the shorthand: $$A\approx\int_{a}^{b}f(x)dx$$
8. Functions must be continuous in order for us to find their integrals
9. Functions that are infinitely discontinuous cannot be integrated
10. $$\int_{a}^{b}f(x)dx = -\int_{b}^{a}f(x)dx$$
11. $$\int_a^af(x)dx =0$$
12. $$\int_a^bwf(x) = w\int_a^bf(x)$$
13. $\int_0^{\frac{\pi}{2}} sin(x)dx = -[cos(x)]_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{2}} = 1$
14. $\int_0^{\frac{\pi}{2}} cos(x)dx = [sin(x)]_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{2}} = (0-1) = -1$

10. Aspen Plus V14
11. Practice Task
	1. Ammonia Reactor
	2. Use NRTL method
	3. Use Reactor RStoic with $15\%$ Conversion of $N_2$
	4. Use Feed with Motor Flow of $H_2$ as $100 mol/h$ and $N_2$ as $30 mol/h$ with normal temperature and pressure conditions (25C and 1 atm)
	5. Use the Following Reaction: $$N_2 + 3H_2 \to 2NH_3$$
	6. Reaction Conditions: 400C and 100 Bar Pressure
12. Inputs are Temperature, Flow, and Pressure
13. Outputs are Automatically Calculated
14. FOSS Alternatives of Aspen are: [[DWSIM]] and COCO

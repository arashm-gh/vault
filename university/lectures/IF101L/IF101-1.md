- Engineering Management Program
- Introduction to Technology and Innovation
- You make things to put in the market
- > *Human needs are states of felt deprivation. (Physical needs.)*
- > *Wants are the form taken my human needs as they are shaped by [[Culture]] and individual [[Personality]]. People have unlimited wants but limited [[Resources]].*
- > *When backed by buyer power, wants become [[Demand]]s. [[Customer]]s choose [[Product]]s as the best bundle for their [[Money]].*
- As engineers you identify needs, wants, and demands and then build something to sell.
- > *[[Innovation]] is the [[Transformation]] of ideas and invention into a good or service that creates value or for which customers will pay.*
- Goals of Innovation:
	- Improving Quality
	- Creation of new [[Market]]
	- Extension of the product range
	- Reducing [[Labor]] cost
	- Improving [[Production]] process
	- Reducing [[Materials]]
	- Reducing [[Environmental Damage]]
	- Replacement of product/service
	- Reducing [[Energy Consumption]]
- Types of Innovation:
	- Breakthrough
	- Technological
	- Ordinary Innovation(?)
	- Product $\to$ new product, improve existing
	- Process $\to$ improve process
- Open Innovation:
	- Inflow and Outflow of knowledge to accelerate internal innovation, and expand the market for external use of innovation
	- Inside-out Innovation: When a company makes skills and resources available to the outside world
	- Outside-In Innovation: Drawing on non-employees
- [[Glocalization]]: Creating at home and selling [[Internationally]]
- [[Innovation-Driven]] [[Economy]] vs. [[Factor-Driven]] [[Economy]]

		- Health
		- IoT (>26 Billion devices)
- Methods of Ideas
	- [[Focus Group]] $\to$ Provide information in a structured format
	- [[Brainstorming]] $\to$ Group method for new ideas
	- [[Reverse Brainstorming]]  Criticize and Refine ideas

	- [[Gordon Method]] $\to$ Unknown origin of Issue 
	- [[Checklist Method]] $\to$ List of related issues
	- [[Free Association]] $\to$ Chain of Word Associations
	- 
	- 
	- Forced Relationships $\to$ 
	- Big-dream Approach $\to$ 
	- Parameter Analysis $\to$ 
-  Five Major Stages:
	- Idea Stage
	- Concept Stage ([[Conceptualization]])
	- Product Development Stage ([[Prototype]])

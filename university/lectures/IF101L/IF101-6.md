#Lecture 
1. Fuel Analysis
2. Note down results at the end of the lecture
3. Fuel is any substance that when passed through a specific chemical process gives us energy or power
	1. e.g. [[Liquid Petroleum Gas]] gives us heat and uses up [[Oxygen]]
4. Fuel is gotten from different sources
	1. Two categories
		1. Primary Fuel
			1. Originate from Natural Processes
			2. Further processed into fuels
			3. e.g. [[Crude Oil]] turns into [[Naphtha]], [[Kerosene]] ([[Ether]]? laal tang), [[Diesel]], [[Furnace Oil]]
				1. [[Furnace Oil]] is turned into lubricants
			4. [[Wood]]
			5. [[Water]] in Hydroelectric Power
			6. Natural Gas
			7. [[Coal]]
		2. Secondary Fuel
			1. Originate from Synthetic Processes
			2. Everything made from a Refinery is a Secondary Fuel
			3. [[Petrol]]
			4. [[Ethanol]]
			5. [[Kerosene]]
			6. [[Charcoal]]
				1. Heated in the absence of [[Oxygen]]
5. Phases of Fuel
	1. Solid
		1. [[Coal]]
		2. [[Charcoal]]
		3. [[Wood]]
	2. Liquid
		1. [[Petrol]]
		2. [[Ethanol]]
	3. Gas
		1. [[Liquid Petroleum Gas]]
		2. [[Hydrogen]]
		3. [[Oxygen]]
		4. [[Compressed Natural Gas]]
6. Properties of Fuel
	1. [[Flash Point]]
	2. [[Fire Point]]
	3. [[Cloud Point]]
		1. Cars have Filters that prevent large molecules from entering the engine and the waxing will prevent any fuel from entering the engine
	4. [[Pour Point]]
		1. Lubricants lose their lubricating properties
	5. [[Aniline Point]]
		1. Used to check the aromatic content of a material
	6. [[API gravity]]
7. To maintain their pressure, storage tanks release fuel vapors.
8. [[Autoignition]] of [[Diesel]]

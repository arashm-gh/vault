#Lecture 
1. [[Fire Safety]]
2. Humanity's first great technological leap
3. Fire is a good servant but a bad master
4. Fire is an **exothermic combustion reaction that releases large amount of heat, smoke, and light** as the main products of combustion.
5. Consequences of Fire
	1. Death, Personal Loss
	2. Global Warming
	3. Biodiversity
	4. Water Contamination
	5. Property Damage
	6. [[Hydrogen Cyanide]] and [[Carbon Monoxide]]

9. 70 questions and 80 questions 
10. Fire Triangle (Old School methodology)
	1. Fuel $\Leftrightarrow$ Ignition $\Leftrightarrow$ Oxygen
11. [[Fire Tetrahedron]]
	1. Heat $\Leftrightarrow$ Fuel $\Leftrightarrow$ Oxygen $\Leftrightarrow$ Chemical Chain Reaction
	2. Cool $\Leftrightarrow$ Remove Fuel Source $\Leftrightarrow$ Smother Supply $\Leftrightarrow$ Interrupt
12. [[Etiological Argument]], [[Ontological Argument]], [[Cosmological Argument]]
13. [[Stages of Fire Development]]
14. Principles of Heat Transmission and Fire Spread
	1. Direct Burning
	2. Ignition Temperature
	3. Conduction needs a medium
	4. Convention needs a medium
	5. Radiation electromagnetic waves needs no medium
15. You have **3 minutes** to leave a building once a fire starts
16. Principles of Fire Extinction
	1. Cooling
	2. Smothering: Fire Blankets and Water
	3. Starvation
	4. Break Chain Reaction
17. Fire Prevention System
	1. Active Fire Protection
		1. [[Fire Suppression]]: Stand Pipes, Fire Extinguisher, Hydrant 
		2. [[Sprinkler]]: Quick Response, Standard Response
		3. [[Fire Detector]]: Smoke Detector, Heat Detector, Fire Alarm
		4. Hypoxic (Hypo-Oxygen) Air Fire Prevention: Nitrogen/Carbon Dioxide Gas Fire Suppression System
	2. Passive Fire Protection
		1. Fire Resistance Rated Walls/Doors
		2. [[Firewall]]
		3. Fire-resistant glass
		4. Fire-resistance rated floors
		5. Occupancy Separations
	3. General [[Fire Prevention]]
		1. Be fire safety aware
		2. Use electrical good equipment
		3. Control ignition sources
		4. Proper Storage of Fuels (Red, Blue, Yellow, Green)
		5. Blocking Fire Exits
		6. Good House Keeping
18. Evacuation Procedure
	1. Call Security 62333 (AcB) or 2333 
	2. Do not delay your escape but try to close doors and turn off equipment
	3. Internal Doors are cool
	4. No lifts
	5. Keep low to the floor
	6. Leave the building immediately
	7. Go to the Assembly Area
19. Courage is not the absence of fear but the realization that there is something more important than fear.

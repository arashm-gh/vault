#Lecture
1. Evacuation Procedure
	1. Leave
	2. Assemble Properly 
	3. Help disabled 
2. Fire Emergency Rescue
	1. Rescue any person in immediate danger
	2. Alarm activation is important do not assume it is on
	3. Contain the fire by closing emergency doors
	4. Extinguish the fire if trained and it's safe
3. Firefighting Decision Criteria
	1. Know the procedures
	2. Know the locations of extinguishers
	3. Always sound the alarm
	4. Avoid Smoke
	5. Ensure the area is evacuated
	6. Don't attempt to fight unless
		1. Alarm is sounded
		2. Fire is small and contained
		3. You have a safe egress route
		4. Available extinguishers are rated and sized
4. Fire Classifications
	1. Class A
		1. **Ordinary Combustibles**
		2. Wood, Paper, Rubber, Fabrics, Plastics
		3. $(0,10]$ Minutes Incipient Stage
		4. $>10$ Minutes Blaze Stage
	2. Class B
		1. **Flammable Liquids**
		2. Gas, Oil, Paint, Alcohol
		3. $(0,1]$ Minutes Incipient Stage
		4. $>1$ Minutes Blaze Stage
	3. Class C
		1. **Electrical Equipment**
		2. Wiring, Fuse box, Appliances, Breakers
		3. $(0, 30]$ Seconds Incipient Stage
		4. $>30$ Seconds Blaze Stage
	4. Class D
		1. **Combustible Materials**
		2. Magnesium, Lithium, Titanium
		3. Leads to another class of fire
	5. Class K
		1. **Cooking Media**
		2. Vegetable oils, Grease
5. Stages of Fire
	1. Incipient $\Rightarrow$ Manageable and Small fire
	2. Blaze $\Rightarrow$ Too large and dangerous
6. Fires can mutate into different stages as it continues and consumes fuels
7. [[Fire Extinguisher]]
	1. For Small fires
	2. Labels
		1. Discharge Level
		2. Pressure Gauge
		3. Discharge Locking Pin and Seal
		4. Carrying Handle
		5. Discharge Hose
		6. Data Plate
		7. Discharge Nozzle
		8. Body
		9. Discharge Orifice
	3. Not intended for out-of-control fires
8. Fire Extinguisher Types
	1. [[Pressurized Water Extinguisher]]
		1. Class A Fires
		2. 2.5 gal water at 150-175 psi (Up to 1 minute discharge time)
		3. Has pressure gauge
		4. 30-40 ft. maximum effective range
		5. Can be started and stopped
		6. Extinguishes by cooling
	2. [[Carbon Dioxide Extinguisher]]
		1. Class B Fires, Class C Fires
		2. 2.5-100 Ib. of $CO_2$ gas at 150-200 psi (8-30 second discharge time)
		3. Has no pressure gauge
		4. 3-8 ft. maximum effective range
		5. Extinguishes by smothering
		6. Not for class A because of limited cooling and re-ignition
	3. [[Multipurpose Dry Chemical Extinguisher]]
		1. Class A Fires, Class B Fires or Class C Fires
		2. 2.5-20 lb. dry chemical (ammonium phosphate) at 50-200 psi by nitrogen gas (8-25 seconds discharge time)
		3. Has pressure gauge
	4. [[Halon Extinguisher]]
		1. Class B Fires, Class C Fires
		2. Best choice for valuable electronics
		3. Short range 3-6ft
		4. Discharges 5-10 seconds
		5. Disperses quickly
		6. Halon weight-for-weight twice as effective as $CO_2$
			1. Larger halon 1211 also rated for Class A Fires
		7. Leads to [[Greenhouse Gas Emission]]
9. Summary
	1. Insert later
10. Color codes
11. Fuel Load
12. P = Pull the pin, A = Aim the nozzle, S = Squeeze, S = Sweep
13. Different standards but one lever will always be for carrying and one for shooting
14. Fire Door
	1. 20-180 minutes
	2. Positive Latching
	3. Be Self Closing
15. Work Practices
	1. Report

	7. Extinguishers	
		1. Mounted Extinguishers
		2. Tags
	8. Housekeeping
		1. Reducde
		2. Minimize

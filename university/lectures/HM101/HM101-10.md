	12. *4. The Impact: Beyond Academic Performance*
	13. *Academic Performance*
	14. *Psychological Well-being*
	15. *Professional Preparedness*
	16. *5. Conclusion: Cultivating Temporal Intelligence*
2. Q2) Based on your survey, what is the article's central thesis or main argument?

3. Q3) List the 5 main headings of the article:
	1. *Introduction: The Scarcity of Attention in an Economy of Time*
	2. *Theoretical Foundations: From To-Do Lists to Cognitive Models*
	3. *Core Components of the Time Management Architecture*

	3. *[[Pomodoro Technique]]* = Breaking work into 25 minutes of focused work and 5 minutes breaks
	4. [[Time Blocking]] = Scheduling specific blocks of time for specific tasks
	5. *[[Metacognition]]* = Thinking about your thinking

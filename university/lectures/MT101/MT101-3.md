#Lecture
- Sketch a graph for: $W = \{ (x,y) | y =2x-1 \}$ 
	- All you need is the x and y intercept
- $y=x^2$ is a [[Parabola]] at $(0,0)$ 
- to move it UP we change it to $y=x^2 -3$ 
- to move it to the RIGHT we change it to $y=(x-3)^2$ 
- it's $-3$ because we're trying to find a value for $x$ that when it is equated with $0$ it turns into $3$.
- OR Our point of view ($y=(x-3)^2$) is also to the $-3$ of the original curve so we go that way!
- $W= \{(x,y): |x| \leq 2, |y| \leq 1\}$ is a set of coordinates where $(-2,-1)$ is the left-most bottom point and $(2,1)$ is the rightmost top point
- $f(x)$ converts one set of values into another set of values.
- *[[Domain]]* is the set of values we're trying to transform and the *[[Range]]* is the values we want the function to transform the inputs to
- $f(x) = f(-x)$ (even)
- $f(-x) = -f(x)$ (odd)
- $(f-g)(x) = f(x)-g(x)$, $(f+g)(x) = f(x)+g(x)$, $(fg)(x) = f(x) \times g(x)$, $(f/g)(x) = \frac{f(x)}{g(x)}$
- $f \cdot g(x) = f(g(x))$
- $log(a) + log(b) = log(ab)$
- $log(a+b) = log(a) \times log(b)$
- **ALREADY KNOWN FORMULAS WILL NOT BE GIVEN** e.g.: $\frac{d}{d\theta}(cos2\theta)$

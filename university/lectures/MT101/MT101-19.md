1. A North-South Highway intersects an East-West at Point P. A Car crosses P at 10AM, moving east at 20 miles per hour. At the same time another car 20 miles north of P is travelling south at 50 miles per hour. Find the time when the cars are closest and the minimum distance.
	1. [[Optimization Problem]]
	2. $v = \frac{d}{t}$
		1. $d = vt$
	3. $C_A(t) = 20t$
	4. $C_B(t) = 2-50t$
	5. $(D_{min})^2 = (C_A(t))^2 + (C_B(t))^2$
		1. $(D_{min})^2 = (20t)^2 + (2-50t)^2$
		2. $(D_{min})^2 = 400t^2 + (2500t^2 + 2(-50t)(2) + 4)$
		3. $(D_{min})^2 = 2900t^2 -200t +4$
		4. $D_{min} = \sqrt{2900t^2 -200t +4}$
			1. $D_{min}' = \frac{1}{2}(2900t^2 -200t +4)^{-\frac{1}{2}} \times (5800t - 200)$
			2. $\frac{1}{2(2900t^2 -200t +4)} \times (5800t - 200) = 0$
			3. ${1} \times (5800t - 200) = 0$
			4. $t = \frac{200}{5800} = \frac{1}{29}$
		5. $D_{min} = \sqrt{2900t^2 - 200t + 4}$
			1. $D_{min} = \sqrt{2900(\frac{1}{29})^2 - 200(\frac{1}{29}) + 4}$
			2. $D_{min} = \frac{4\sqrt{29}}{29} = 0.742$
2. A Farmer has $2040ft$ of fencing. He wishes to make one square field and one rectangular field, with one side twice the other. Find the dimensions that maximize the area.
	1. $A_R(l) = 2l^2$
		1. $A_S(l)' = 4l$
	2. $A_S(l) = (\frac{2040-6l}{4})^2 = (-1.5l + 510)^2 = 2.25l^2 + 2(-1.5l)(510) + 260100$
		1. $A_R(l) = 4.5l - 1530$
	3. $4l + 4.5l - 1530 = 0$
		1. $8.5l = 1530$
		2. $l = 180$
	4. $R: 180 \times 360$
	5. $S: 240$
	6. As $A'' = \frac{17}{2} > 0 \to$ Minima whereas the question asked for the Maxima

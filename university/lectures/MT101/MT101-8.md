###### Continuity in functions
- A function $f(x)$ $is continuous on $[a,b]$ if:
  $f(x)$ exists for $x \in (a,b)$
  and $\lim_{x\to a^+}f(x), \lim_{x\to b^-}f(x)$ both exist
- $f(x) = \sqrt{9-x^2}$ will exist for $-3 \leq x \leq 3$ or $x \in [-3,3]$
  $\lim_{x\to -3^+}f(x), \lim_{x\to +3^-}f(x)$ both exist
- $f(x) = \pm \sqrt{9-x^2}$ is not possible because then one input will have 2 outputs.
- $f(x) = \frac{\sqrt{x^2 -9}}{x-4}$. Find the range for which it is continuous.
  First we find where is it not: $x \neq 4, x \geq 3, x \leq -3$ 
  So: $x \in (-\infty, -3] \cup [3, 4) \cup (4,\infty)$
  This is called a [[Piecewise Continuous Function]].
  It forms [[Asymptote]]s at $f(4)$ with $-\infty$ and $\infty$.  
###### Marking Rules
- $50$-$60$ questions that are practice questions. 2 out of that set of questions will be part of the assignment. You must submit the practice questions to the T.A. 
- Sir mentioned MIT Calculus 1 as a possible source of questions.

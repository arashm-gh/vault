1. If $x^3+y^3 = 16$, Find $\frac{d^2y}{d^2x}$ at $(2,2)$.
	1. $3x^2 + 3y'y^2 = 0$
	2. $y' = \frac{-x^2}{y^2}$
	3. $y'' = \frac{(-x^2)(2yy')+(y^2)(-2x)}{y^4}$
	4. $y'' = \frac{(-x^2)(\frac{-2x^2}{y})-2xy^2}{y^4}$
	5. $y'' = \frac{(\frac{2x^4}{y})-2xy^2}{y^4}$
	6. $y'' = -\frac{2xy^3 + 2x^4}{y^5}$
	7. $y'' = -\frac{2(2)(2)^3 + 2(2)^4}{2^5}$
	8. $y'' = -\frac{32 + 32}{32}$
	9. $y''= -2$
2. Water runs into a conical tank at the rate of $9ft^3/min$. The tank has a stands point down with a height of $10ft$ and base radius $5ft$. How fast is the water level rising when the water is $6ft$ deep?
	1. $V = \pi r^2 \frac{h}{3}$
	2. $r = \frac{h}{2} \Rightarrow \frac{1}{3}\pi (\frac{h}{2})^2h = \frac{1}{12}\pi h^3$
	3. Using the rules of equivalent triangles, we can assume that when $h = 10$, $r = 5$ and so the relationship between $r$ and $h$ is $r = \frac{h}{2}$.
	4. $\frac{dV}{dh} = \frac{1}{4}\pi h^2$
	5. $\frac{dV}{dt} = \frac{dV}{dh} \times \frac{dh}{dt}$
	6. $\frac{dh}{dt} = \frac{1}{\pi}$
3. A hot air balloon rising straight up from a level field is tracked by a range finder $150m$ from the lift off point. At the moment the range finder's elevation angle is $\frac{\pi}{4}$, the angle is increasing at the rate of $0.14rad/min$. How fast is the balloon rising at this moment?
	1. $h = 150tan(\theta)$
	2. $\frac{dh}{d \theta} = 150sec^2(\theta)$
	3. ...
	4. $\frac{dh}{dt} = 42$

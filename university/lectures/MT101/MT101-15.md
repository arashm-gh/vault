#Lecture 
1. This lecture was given by the TA, Waseem Akram
2. [[Linearization]]
3. The further you go from the value of a [[Derivative]] on the line it defines the further and more error-prone the value gets
4. $f(x) = \sqrt{1+x}$ at $x=0$
	1. $f(0) = 1$
	2. $f'(x) = \frac{1}{2\sqrt{1+x}} \Rightarrow \frac{1}{2}$
	3. $L(x) = 1+0.5x$
5. $f(x) = \sqrt{1+x}$ at $x=3$
	1. $f(3) = 2$
	2. $f'(3) = \frac{1}{2\sqrt{1+3}} = 0.25$
	3. $L(x) = 2+\frac{1}{4}(x-3)$
6. $f(x) = cos(x)$ at $x = \frac{\pi}{2}$
	1. $L(x) = ???$
7. [[Binomial Theorm]] is an example of [[Linearization]]:
	1. $(1+x)^n \approx 1+nx$
		1. e.g.: ${1+5x^2}^{\frac{1}{3}} \approx 1+\frac{5}{3}x^2$
8. $f(x) = x^2 + 2x$ at $x = 0$
	1. $f(0) = 0$
	2. $f'(0) = 2$
	3. $L(x) = 0+2(x-0) = 2x$
	4. $L(0) = 0$
9. I feel like a better way to teach this lecture would've been to first give the class a very complicated function and then given them an unrealistically little amount of time to solve this question. Once most of the people fail, you tell them about what [[Linearization]] is an how you can use it in an exam or something.
   After that I would not slap on the topic of [[Differentials]] in the last 20 minutes.
10. Differentials
	1. $dx, dy$
	2. $dy = f'(x)dx$
		1. $y = f(x)$
		2. $y_1,y_2, ... \Rightarrow x_1, x_2, ...$


11. Fine analysis is required for engineering 
	1. e.g.: Suspension system of a car
		1. Bobs up and down
		2. Never linear, usually differential
		3. Gives approximate result for how it will behave
12. Differentials
	1. e.g.: How low will a car go from the force $\to$ Spring and Force

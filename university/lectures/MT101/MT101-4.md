- $\lim_{x\to5} (x-2)$. *$x$ "approaches" the value of $5$.*
- To define a limit we need an expression and a value.
- **Why do we need [[Limits]]?**
- $\lim_{x\to2}(\frac{1}{x-2}) \Rightarrow$ **UNDEFINED**
  The graph approaches different infinities when we come at it from the negative or positive direction.
- In pure math $\pm 2$ is an acceptable term, however in [[Engineering]] the $-2$ value can be discarded and to understand why or what to discard we need to understand limits.
- For limit $lim \to+\infty \quad x \in (2, \infty), x \in \mathbb{R}$ 
- $\lim_{x\to2}(\frac{x^2 -4}{x-2}) \Rightarrow \lim_{x\to2}(\frac{(x+2)(x-2)}{x-2}) \Rightarrow limit \to 4$
- **Why is it UNDEFINED and not $\pm \infty$?**

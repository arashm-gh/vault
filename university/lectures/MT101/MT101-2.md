#Lecture
- Waseem Akram TA - G-31 Basic Sciences
- Midterm 30%, Final 40%, Quizzes + Assessments 30%
- Take everything seriously
- Exams will be harder than the quizzes
- Practice all topics
- 5 Assignments and 5 Quizzes
- Assignment Quizzes will be from the Assignments and happen during the Quiz
- **No [[Calculator]] Course**
- Formula Sheet and Cheat Sheet will be shared with the CR
- Join the MS Teams (link with CR)
- Don't write anything on the Sheets
- **Only [[Real Numbers]]**

- $|a|$ = [[Magnitude]] of $a$, Numerical value of $a$
- $sgn(a)$ = $+1$ if $a \geq 0$, $-1$ if $a < 0$
- $|\sqrt{2} -2| = 2- \sqrt{2}$
- $|a+b| \ll |a|+|b|$
- $(a,b)$: [[Open Interval]], $(a,b]$: [[Semi Open/Closed Interval]], $[a,b]$: Closed Interval]]
- $x^2 -7x +10 > 0 \to \frac{-b^2+\sqrt{4ac}}{2a} = x \to (-\inf, 2)\cup(5, \inf)$
- $|2x-7| > 3 \to 2x -7 > 3$ and $2x-7 < -3$ $\to x > 5$ and $x < 2$
- "[[Differentiable Piecewise Function]]"

#Lecture 
1. Gel Ball model for analysis of defects
2. [[Polymer]] balls absorb [[Water]] and become larger in size
3. Temperature
	1. Average kinetic energy in the atoms and/or molecules in a substance
4. All real crystals have imperfections in their structure
	1. These are known as crystal defects
5. Introduced during:
	1. Solidification
	2. High Temperatures
6. Glass is amorphous
	1. Made of silica
	2. Cooled very quickly
7. Types of Defects
	1. [[Point Defect]] $\to$ [[0D]]
		1. Types
			1. Vacancies
				1. Lack of presence of an atom at a lattice point
			2. Adatom
				1. Extra atom on the surface of crystal
			3. Interstitial Defect
				1. Atom is inserted at a normally unoccupied position
			4. Substitutional Defect
				1. Atom is replaced with another atom
		2. In Ceramics (Ionic Bonding)
			1. [[Frenkel Defect]]
				1. Cation vacancy
				2. Cation Interstitial pair
				3. Atom moves to the side
			2. [[Schottky Defect]]
				1. Cation and Anion removed from interior and moved to the external surface of the crystal
				2. Require activation energy $Q$
	2. [[Surface Defect]] $\to$ [[2D]]
		1. [[Grains]]
			1. Parts of a crystal water will start to freeze at multiple points at the same time
			2. They will have different orientations
			3. As they grow they will grow [[Grain Boundaries]]
			4. Grain boundaries are taken as a defect
	3. [[Volume Defect]] $\to$ [[3D]]
		1. Types of Defects
			1. Voids
			2. Precipitation Defect
			3. Bubble Defect = air has been trapped
	4. [[Line Defect]] $\to$ [[1D]]
		1. Types
			1. Edge Dislocation
				1. Slip Plane
				2. Defect Free Material
			2. Skew Dislocation

#Lecture 
1. Introduction to [[Metallography]]
2. Next Week midterm everything is included
3. Metallography is the study of the Microstructure
4. Microscopes
	1. [[Optical Microscope]] $\to$ Uses light
	2. [[Scanning Electron Microscope]] $\to$ Scanning Electrons
	3. [[Transmission Electron Microscope]]
	4. [[X-ray Diffraction Microscope]] $\to$ [[X-Ray]] [[Diffraction|diffracts]] [[Visible Light|Light]]
5. Different phases of material reflect light differently
6. Phase Distribution of Material
7. Analysis of Microcracks and Stress cracks
8. Sample Prep
	1. Cutting/Sectioning
		1. Thin piece of metal is cut
	2. Mounting
		1. Focus is a tiny point
		2. Epoxy is used 
		3. Cut again
		4. Hot
			1. Uses heat and pressure with [[Resin]]
		5. Cold
			1. Uses mold media without heat or pressure
		6. Done for especially small substances
	3. Grinding
		1. Done using [[Silicon Carbide]]
		2. Flatten surface for viewing
		3. Grain Size
		4. Grit
	4. Polishing
		1. Alumina or Diamond paste
		2. Maximize reflection
	5. Etching
		1. Surface is exposed to a dilute acid
		2. We can't tell after polishing where the boundaries are
		3. [[Acid]] reacts to different phases differently
		4. Etchant examples: [[Kroll Solution]]
9. Microscope
	1. Viewing using Reflected Light
	2. Resolution = Clarity of Image
	3. Magnification = Difference between original size and reflected image
	4. Grain Boundaries are always darker because of the different orientation of atoms. They are regions of high entropy and disorder. 
10. American Standard of Testing Materials grain size
	1. $N=2^{n-1}$
		1. Average number of grains at $100x$ per inch
		2. at $100x$ Magnification
	2. $N_M(\frac{M}{100})^2 = 2^{n-1}$
		1. At magnifications of not $100x$
11. Lab Safety
	1. Wear [[Personal Protective Equipment|PPE]] specified on [[Material Safety Data Sheet|MSDS]]
	2. Information of handling chemicals

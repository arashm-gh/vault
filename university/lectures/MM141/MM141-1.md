- Fundamental to Technology and Innovation
- [[Metals]]:
	- Dense
	- Good [[Conductor]]s
	- [[Strong]] and [[Ductile]]
	- Can be shaped
	- e.g.: [[Aluminum]], [[Iron]], [[Copper]]
	- Applications: [[Construction]], [[Automobiles]], [[Electrical Wiring]], [[Aerospace]], etc.
- [[Ceramics]]:
	- Non-metialic [[Solids]]
	- [[Metal Oxides]], [[Metal Carbides]]
	- [[Hard]] and [[Brittle]]
	- High [[Melting Point]]
	- Excellent thermal and Electrical [[Insulator]]s.
	- e.g.: [[Alumina]], [[Silicon Carbide]], [[Zirconia]], [[Tungsten Carbide]], etc.
	- Applications: [[Cutting Tools]], [[Aerospace]], [[Biomedical Implants]]
- [[Polymers]]:
	- Long chains of organic molecules made of repeating chains of [[Monomers]]
	- [[Lightweight]] and [[Flexible]]
	- Low [[Strength]] compared to [[Metals]]
	- Good [[Corrosion]] resistance
	- e.g.: [[Polyethylene]], [[Nylon]], [[PVC]], etc.
	- Applications: [[Packaging]], [[Textiles]], etc.
- [[Composites]]:
	- Made from combining two or more distinct materials
	- Tailored properties
	- Often stronger and lighter than individual components
	- Can be designed for specific use
	- e.g.: [[Carbon Fiber-Reinforced Polymer]], [[Fiberglass]], etc.
	- Applications: [[Aircraft]], [[Sports Equipment]], [[Automobiles]], [[Wind Turbine Blades]], etc.
- Modern Materials
	- [[Graphene]]:
		- Made from [[Graphite]]
		- High strength
		- Flexible
		- Strong
		- [[Carbon Nanotube]] and [[Fullerene]]
	- [[Piezoelectric]] Materials
		- Respond to [[Mechanical Stress]] with [[Electric Potential]]
		- Many uses 
		- e.g.: [[Quartz]]
	- [[Shape Memory Alloys]]
		- They remember their original shape
		- [[Robotics]], [[Aerospace]], [[Biomedical]]
		- [[Phase Transformation]] (Low and High temperature)
		- [[Martensite]] structure is remembered
		- [[Austenite]] is the deformed structure
	- [[Hydroxyapatite Bioceramic]]
		- Human Hard Tissue
		- [[Bioactive]], [[Nontoxic]]
- [[Integrated Circuits]]
	- Fixed number of components to create a circuit
- [[Printed Circuit Boards]]
	- Made according needs using ICs

	- [[Hydrogen]] [[Atom]]'s brought together ([[Inter-Nuclear]] [[Distance]] decreased) affects the potential energy of both [[Atoms]]. The energy keeps going down until the lowest value. Going past the lowest value and still forcing them together leads to the energy increasing exponentially.

- Quizzes will have both practical application questions and straightforward questions on topics.
- [[Bond Length]] $\propto$ 1/[[Energy]] Needed
- When we go lower on the periodic table we get weaker bonds
- Types of Bonds
	- Primary ([[Inter-Atomic]]) 
		- [[Covalent Bonds]]
			- Sharing of Electrons
		- [[Ionic Bonds]]
			- [[Ceramic]] [[Materials]] usually have this bond
			- Giving/Taking of [[Electrons]]
		- [[Metallic Bonds]]
			- Need very low activation energy
			- Close to Ionic bond
		- [[Partial Covalent Bonds]]
	- Secondary ([[Inter-Molecular]])
		- [[Hydrogen]] [[Bonds]]
			- Involves [[Hydrogen]] and an [[Electronegative]] [[Element]]
			- HCl is [[Induced Dipole]]
		- [[Van der Waal's Force]]
			- Temporary (Induced) or permanent [[Dipoles]]
		- [[Dispersion Forces]]
- Bonds are a [[Vector Quantity]] (Excluding Ionic bonds)
- Induced Dipole: Partial charge because of movement of electron cloud
- [[DNA]] molecules have different types of bonds in them

- Chapter 1 and 2 over!

- Solids can be [[Crystalline]] or [[Amorphous]]
- [[Quartz]] and [[Glass]] are both [[Silica]] but Crystalline and Amorphous, respectively.
- [[Copper]] is a [[Crystalline Metal]]. It has [[Grains]] under a [[Microscope]]. Different grains reflect light at different planes.
- [[Grains]] are blocks of crystals with [[Atoms]] are the center. They are arranged in layers and layers.  
- ![[Formation of Crystals in Materials - Textbook.png]]
- This is called [[Reduced Sphere Bonding]]. [[Atoms]] are not spheres they are represented as hard balls. In reality atoms are packed with minimal space between them ([[ABC Packing]], [[ABA Packing]], etc.)
- [[Nucleus]]: Central structure
- [[Grain Boundary]] is more energetic than the [[Grain Interior]]s
- [[Formation of Grains]]: ![[Formation of Grains in Materials - Textbook.png]]
- [[Poly-Crystalline]] has Grains
- [[Single Crystal]] of [[Iron]] 
- Tin transform from one crystal from another undergoing 27% volume change. [[White Tin]] $\to$ [[Gray Tin]].
- There are multiple crystal systems
	- We only need to worry about [[Cube]] and [[Hexagon]]
- BCC ([[Base Centered Cubic]]), FCC ([[Face Centered Cubic]]), HCP ([[Hexagon Closed Pack]])
- [[Coordinate System]] for understanding crystal structure (x (in-out) y (right-left) z (up-down))
- How to locate:
	- [[Points]] ($0D$)
	- [[Directions]] ($1D$)
	- [[Planes]] ($2D$)
- Entirety of Tech industry is based off of [[Doping of Silicon Crystals]]
- To identify the positions of [[Doping]], the conventional coordinate system is used. e.g.:
  $q = \frac{1}{4}, r= 1, s=\frac{1}{2}$
  along $x, y, z = q, r, s$ in unit cell 
  $(z:0.4mm, x:0.48mm, y:0.46mm)$
  $(qx = 0.12, ry = 0.46, zs =0.2)$
- Callister set the standard with a $0\, 0\, 0$ standard instead of $(0,0,0)$
- $[\,\,]$ is for direction, $(\,\,)$ is for defining a plane

#Lecture
- [[Physics]] vs. [[Chemistry]]
- Chapter 1 and 2 of the book of Callister is self study
- [[Material Science]] is the combination of [[Physics]] and [[Chemistry]]
- [[Solids]], [[Atomic Bodies]], [[Electron Behavior]], [[Microscopy]] & [[Spectroscopy]], [[Thermodynamics]],
- [[Classification]]:
	- [[Metal]] $\to$ [[Ferrous]], [[Non-Ferrous]]
	- [[Non-Metal]] $\to$ [[Ceramic]] ([[Metals]] reacted with nonmetals), [[Composites]], [[Polymers]] (chains of [[Carbon]] and [[Hydrogen]])
- We will look at the [[Structure]], [[Properties]], [[Characteristics]], [[Performance]], and [[Processing]] of [[Materials]]
- [[Hardness]] (A property of materials) $\to$[[Plastic Deformation]] 
- Processing $\to$ Affects the properties and structure
- [[Quinching]] is putting a hot material into [[Water]]
- [[Nanotechnology]]  $10^{-9}$ Nano-[[Transistors]] 
- [[Silver]] is [[Antibacterial]] in nature
- [[Size]] affects [[Optical Properties]]
- [[Surface-Area]] to [[Volume]] Ratio Affects [[Catalytic Activity]]
- [[Iron]] makes up 7% of the [[Earth]]'s crust
- Carbon mixes into Iron's [[Crystal]] structure
- 6-weight-% of [[Steel]] (max) is carbon
- [[Low-Carbon Steel]], [[Medium-Carbon Steel]], [[High-Carbon Steel]] are grades of steel
- [[Toughness]] $\to$ How much energy an object can absorb before it [[Fracture]]
- [[Machine-able]], [[Weldable]]
- Material Scientists are looking to make an [[Alternative]] for [[Glass]], [[Plastic]], and [[Tin]]/[[Aluminium]] 
- [[Single Crystal]] $\to$ [[Visible]], [[Porous]] $\to$ [[Opaque]]
- [[Human]] [[Bone]] is a natural composite
- We design materials according to what material we want

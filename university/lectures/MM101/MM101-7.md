#Lecture 
1. We're behind other sections
2. Crystallographic Planes
3. Use $Tail - Head$ method to find the miller indices of anything that is not on the origin 
4. Some Properties are directional and we use Miller Indices to explain this about substances
5. Denser planes have the capability to resist fracture
6. Tips for miller indices
	1. Square plane has two zeros
	2. Rectangular plane has one zero
	3. Triangular plane has no zeros
	4. Direction and Plane are perpendicular
	5. If a plane passes through the origin we can't use it
	6. We switch the origin
	7. We get the point that has the most intercepts with the plane
	8. And is the closest to the plane
	9. Parallelism with any axis means it is infinity
	10. Turn them into the smallest whole numbers
	11. Reciprocate 
	12. Enclose in $(\,\,\,)$
	13. Don't use [[Comma|Commas]], [[Infinite|Infinity]], or Fractions in the $(\,\,\,)$
	14. Front faces when we have a square plane are all positive, and back faces are all negative
	15. Write $O'$ when you shift the origin, with one dash for every shift. $\hookrightarrow$ $O'''$ for $(\bar{1}\,\,\bar{1}\,\,\bar{1})$

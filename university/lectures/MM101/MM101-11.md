#Lecture 
# Chapter 3
1. [[Planar Density]]
2. Further in materials we will learn about [[Stress Concentration]] and [[Cleavages]]
3. Densely packed planes accommodate forces in the best manner
4. Diagonal breakage occurs across densely packed crystallographic planes with the highest density
5. [[Ductile Fracture|Ductile Fractures]] are preferred over [[Brittle Fracture|Brittle Fractures]]
6. [[Stacking Sequence]]
	1. Stacking is done to maximize stability
	2. Atomic Stacking is efficient in terms of Space Consumption and Atomic Packing Factor 
FCC: ```
OOOOOO
OOOOOO
OOOOOO```
 BCC: ```
OOOOOO
 OOOOOO
OOOOOO```
7. Coordination number is 12 in FCC or Cubic Closed Packing (CCP) and HCP
8. ABC type packing in FCC
9. ABA type packing in HCP
10. Voids = Inherent spaces between atoms in a structure
11. Moving the first years GPA is very difficult
12. Coordination Number of HCP = $\frac{1}{6}\times6+\frac{1}{2}\times2+3 = 6$
# Ceramics
1. Ceramics
	1. Class: Metal (losing electron) and Nonmetal (gaining electron)
	2. Brittle, Amorphous Structure
	3. Withstand high temperatures
	4. [[Silica]]
2. [[Kerameikos]] $\to$ Greek Word for Pottery
3. Ceramics: Solid compounds that are formed by the application of heat or heat and pressure on a Nonmetal or Nonmetalic Solid and a Metal

| Metals                 | Ceramics                 |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Crystal Structure      | Crystal Structures       |
| Lots of Free Electrons | Captive Electrons        |
| Good Conductors        | Terrible Conductors      |
| High Tensile Strength  | Low Tensile Strength     |
| Plastic Flow           | None                     |
| Nonporous              | Initial High Porosity    |
| Metalic Bonds          | Ionic/Covalent Bonds     |
| Uniform Atoms          | Different Sizes of Atoms |
| Shear Strength Low     | Shear Strength High      |
| Corrode                | Do not Corrode           |
4. Ceramics are Abrasive
5. Ceramics are the result of Corrosion
6. Taxonomy of Ceramics
	1. Glasses
	2. Clay

	4. Abrasive
	5. Cements
	6. Advanced Ceramics
7. Amorphous Crystalline $\to$ Some order and then Amorphicity started
8. Quiz next Wednesday

#Lecture 
1. Don't use brackets when you're doing working on [[Miller Indices]]
2. Directions
	1. If a direction is starting from the origin then just calculate the indices using the regular method
	2. If a direction is not starting from the origin then use the $H-T$ method
3. Planes
	1. If a plane is not intersecting with the origin then calculate normally
	2. Otherwise, Use the projection method from before
	3. 3 Indices $=$ Triangle, 2 Indices $=$ Rectangle, 1 Indices $=$ Square
4. Families of planes are represented through $\{\,\,\,\}$
	1. We have to draw every $\pm$ for the coordinate
5. We are going towards doping and use of these directions in chemical processing of materials
6. General Formula: $N = N_i + \frac{N_j}{2} + \frac{N_E}{8} + \frac{N_E}{4}$
7. Coordination number
	1. Nearest neighbor atoms
	2. S.C. = 6
	3. B.C.C = 8
	4. F.C.C = 12

#Lecture
- [[Mechanical]] Properties of [[Materials]]:
	- [[Elasticity]]: ability of an object to maintain it's shape after being [[Stretched]] or [[Compressed]]. In [[Metals]] Elasticity is on the atomic scale. [[Elastic Modulus]] is the measurement of Elasticity. 
	- [[Plasticity]]: [[Bonds]] never go back to their original position. The material permanently changes shape.
	- [[Strength]]: Many kinds.
	- [[Hardness]]: Property of a material to resist [[Plastic Deformation]].
	- [[Brittleness]]: Do not show [[Plastic Deformation]] (Hard).
	- [[Ductility]]: Show a lot of [[Plastic Deformation]] (Soft).
	- [[Toughness]]: How much energy a material can absorb till the point of [[Fracture]].
	- [[Stiffness]]: Ability of a material to absorb [[Energy]] till the [[Elastic Limit]]. Stronger resistance to deformation.
	- [[Resilience]]: ???
- [[Fracture-Toughness]] Trends:
	- [[Metals]] are tough and don't fracture easily and absorb a lot of energy.
	- [[Ceramics]] are very [[Brittle]] 
	- [[Polymers]] are less [[Brittle]]
	- [[Composites]] range a lot in their properties because they can be made according to our needs
- [[Conductivity]]:
	- [[Metals]] are [[Conductor]]s
	- [[Ceramics]] are [[Insulator]]s
	- [[Polymers]] are [[Insulator]]s
	- [[Semiconductor]]s only conduct under certain conditions
- [[Conductivity]] and [[Allotropic]] form of [[Carbon]]:
	- [[Graphite]] and [[Graphene]]: [[Conductivity]] is a direction property
	- [[Diamond]] is a poor conductor 
	- [[Carbon Nanotube]] is very conductive
- Properties linked to structure
	- [[Atoms]]
		- Forces are being transferred from one atom to the other
		- Layers of atoms in metals slide against each other which leads to deformation
	- [[Molecules]]
	- [[Crystal]]
	- Micro and Macro
- [[Bond Length]] and Atom Interaction
	- Bonding is the interaction between atoms
	- Graph is a summation of repulsive and attractive forces
	- [[Potential Energy]] is also a graph and goes down.
	- At 74 Picometers the [[Wavefunction]]s (probability cloud) of two [[Hydrogen]] [[Atoms]], according to [[Newton's Third Law]], stop in place. This [[Phenomenon]] is the "bond." Their potential energy has a minimum point where this occurs.
	- $295\textdegree K$ is [[Room Temperature]]
	- ![[Atomic Bond Energy and Forces in Materials Chart - Textbook.png]]
- Definitely read the book.

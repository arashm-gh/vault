# Clothing History
## History and Sociology of Clothing: Some Methodological Observations
> [!info] This book was not for beginners and I did not know that. Instead I'm going to make notes on something easier to read.
1. There was no History of Dress outside of studies in [[Ancient Archaeology]] until the start of the [[Nineteenth Century]]
2. History of dress allowed historians to equate the Zeitgeist and Vestimentary form
3. Proper research began in [[1860]] by many Medievalists
4. Their method was to treat dress as a sum of it's parts

# Introduction
1. The OpenWorm Project is a digital simulation of species of [[Roundworm]]: [[C. elegans]].
2. The project exists in two parts:
	1. Neural Properties are modeled using a [[Hodgkin-Huxley Model]]
	2. Physics Modeled using a [[Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics]] algorithm
3. Modeling was done using software called [[neuroConstruct]]
4. It follows the following feedback loop:
5. Environmental Stimulus $\to$ Sensory Transduction $\to$ Interneuron Firing $\to$ Motor Neuron Firing $\to$ Motor Output $\to$ Environmental Change $\to$ Sensory Transduction.

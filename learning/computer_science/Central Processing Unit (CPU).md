# Introduction
1. Primary Processor in a [[Computer]]
2. Executes Instructions in serially
# History
1. [[History of General Purpose CPUs]]
2. [[ENIAC]] was the first programmable general purpose computer made in 1945
3. The [[ENIAC]] was a [[Fixed-Program Computer]]
4. The term "Central Processing Unit" was made in 1955
5. CPUs came with the advent of [[Stored Program Computer|Stored Program Computers]]
6. [[John Von Neuman]] invented a [[Stored Program Computer]] called the [[EDVAC]]
7. CPUs were originally made specifically for specific computers and tasks with custom designs
8. CPUs were standardized during the [[Discrete Transistor Mainframe]] and [[Minicomputer]] era
9. [[John Von Neuman]], despite it being called the [[Von Neuman Architecture]], was not the first person to come up with the concept of a [[Stored Program Computer]]
	1. [[Konrad Zuse]] suggested and made ideas
	2. The [[Harvard Architecture]] of the [[Harvard Mark I]] was completed before the [[EDVAC]]
		1. The difference was that [[Harvard Architecture]] separated storage for [[CPU Instruction|CPU Instructions]] and data
	3. Most modern CPUs have [[Von Neuman Architecture]]
	4. [[Harvard Architecture]] is used in [[Embedded Systems]], for example the [[Atmel AVR]]
10. [[Relay Computers]] and [[Vacuum Tube Computers]] were mostly made during this era
	1. [[Vacuum Tube Computers]] were faster but less reliable
	2. [[Relay Computers]] were slower but more reliable
	3. In the end, [[Vacuum Tube Computers]] were used instead because their speed outweighed their issues
11. Clock signal frequencies ranged from 100[[kHz]] to 4 [[MHz]]
## Transistor CPUs
1. [[Transistor Computer]]
2. From the [[1950s]] to [[1960s]] they were no longerbuilt with [[Vacuum Tube Computers|Vacuum Tubes]] and [[Relay Computers|Relays]]
3. CPUs could be made on one or several [[Printed Circuit Boards]]
4. In [[1964]], [[IBM]] introduced the [[IBM System/360 Architecture]] computers which were capable of running different programs at different speeds, making it compatible with older systems which was new at the time.
5. [[IBM]] also came up with [[Microcode]]
6. [[IBM System/360 Architecture]] dominated the [[Mainframe Computer]] Market for decades
7. In [[1965]], [[Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC)]] created the [[PDP-8]] aimed at scientific researchers
8. Clock rates were in the tens of [[MHz]]
9. High performance designs like the [[Single Instruction, Multiple Data (SIMD)]] [[Vector Processors]] began to appear

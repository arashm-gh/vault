# Calculus Volume 1

## Definitions

Calculus $\coloneqq$ Branch that looks at the changes in functions.  
Function $\coloneqq$ Describe the relationship between two sets.  
Domain $\coloneqq$ Set of inputs for a function.  
Range $\coloneqq$ Set of outputs for a function.  
$y = f(x)$  

## Definitions of Functions

Set builder notation $\coloneqq$ Used to describe infinite/finite sets using mathematical notation.
For example:  
$\{x^2 | x > 0\}$  

## Representation of Functions

Functions can be represented in different ways:
- Table
- Graph
- Equation
## Combination of Functions

- Sum: $(f + g)(x) = f(x) + g(x)$
- Difference: $(f - g)(x) = f(x) - g(x)$
- Product: $(f * g)(x) = f(x)*g(x)$
- Quotient: $(\frac{f}{g})(x) = \frac{f(x)}{g(x)}$ (for $g(x)$ is not $0$)

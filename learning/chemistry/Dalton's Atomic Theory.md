# Introduction
 1. An element is composed of extremely small, indivisible particles called atoms.
2. All atoms of a given element have identical properties that differ from those of other
elements.
3. Atoms cannot be created, destroyed, or transformed into atoms of another element
via chemical or physical changes.
4. Compounds are formed when atoms of different elements combine with one another
in small whole-number ratios.
5. The relative numbers and kinds of atoms are constant in a given compound.

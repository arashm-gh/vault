# Introduction
1. Sample is placed in a [[Platinum]] furnace boat at the start and excess [[Oxygen]] is provided. 
2. This begins a [[Combustion Reaction]]
3. All the [[Carbon]] in the [[Organic Compound]] will turn into [[Carbon Dioxide]].
4. All the [[Hydrogen]] in the [[Organic Compound]] will turn into [[Water]].
5. [[Magnesium Perchlorate]] is placed in the second cart of the train.
6. [[Sodium Hydroxide]] reacts with [[Carbon Dioxide]].
7. We measure the change in mass of the two substances to get the mass of [[Water]] and [[Carbon Dioxide]] initially produced
8. Mass of substances can be turned into the amount of substance using [[Bridge Method]]
# Example(s)
1. $0.1014g$ sample of [[Organic Compound]] was burned and produced $0.1486g$ of $CO_2$ and $0.0609g$ of $H_2O$
	1. Determine the mass of [[Carbon]], [[Hydrogen]], and [[Oxygen]]
		1. Use the [[Bridge Method]] to calculate the mass of [[Carbon]] or [[Hydrogen]] or [[Oxygen]]
		2. $?g\,C = 0.1486g\,CO_2 \times \frac{12g \, C}{44g \, CO_2} = 0.1486g\,CO_2 \times \frac{1\.mol\,CO_2}{44g\,CO_2} \times \frac{12g\,C}{1\,mol\,CO_2} = 0.04055g \, C$
		3. $?g\,H = 0.0609g\,H_2O \times \frac{2g\,H}{18g\,H_2O} = 0.0068g\,H$
		4. $?g\,O = 0.1014g - [0.04055g\,C + 0.0068g\,H] = 0.0540g\,O$
	2. Determine the percentage
		1. $\frac{Mass\,of\,Element}{Total\,Mass}$
	3. Determine the [[Empirical Formula]].
		1. Turn the mass of each element into the relative number of moles $\hookrightarrow$ $0.04055g\,C \times \frac{1mol\,C}{12.01g\,C} = 0.003376mol\,C$
		2. Divide the smallest mole number by the others to get an [[Empirical Formula]] $\hookrightarrow$ $\frac{0.00676mol\,H}{0.003376mol\,C} = 2.00 H$

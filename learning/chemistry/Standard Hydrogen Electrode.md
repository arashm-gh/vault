#Chemistry 
# Introduction
1. $$Pt_s|H_2(g)|HCl(aq) \Rightarrow H_2(g) \to 2H^+(aq) + 2e^-$$
2. [[Hydrogen]] gas at $1atm$
3. [[Platinum]] powder used for it's surface area
4. Aqueous [[Hydrochloric Acid]]
5. The potential of this is taken to be $0.000$ volts
# Chemical Process
## Oxidation
1. $H_2 \to 2H^+ + 2e^-$
	1. [[Hydrogen]] molecules come near [[Platinum]]
	2. [[Hydrogen]] bonds break
	3. They connect to the [[Platinum]]
	4. [[Hydrogen]] releases electrons into the [[Platinum]]
	5. [[Hydrogen]] detaches from [[Platinum]] as $H^+$ [[Ions]]
## Reduction
1. $2H^+ + 2e^- \to H_2$
	1. [[Hydrogen]] Ions come into contact with [[Platinum]]
	2. [[Platinum]] gives [[Hydrogen]] electrons 
	3. [[Hydrogen]] Ions turn into [[Hydrogen]] atoms
	4. [[Hydrogen]] atoms bond together
2.

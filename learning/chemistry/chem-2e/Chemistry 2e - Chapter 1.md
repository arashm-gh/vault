## Chapter 1: Essential Ideas

> So I've been wanting to do chemistry since my A levels started, but I hated how it was formalized and instead of learning the subject I was forced to study for a test I did not care for. Now that my A level has ended I have the freedom to approach the subject how I've wanted to! And so that's what this is going to be :3

### 1.1 Chemistry in Context

1. Testing $\to$ Constant Observation $\to$ “Law”.
2. Testing $\to$ Hypothesis Supported $\to$ “Theory”, e.g: Kinetic Particle Theory.
3. Microscopic Domain $\coloneqq$ Smol.
4. Macroscopic Domain $\coloneqq$ Normal sized.
5. Symbolic Domain $\coloneqq$ Language used in chemistry to indicate parts of the microscopic and macroscopic domain, e.g: H$_{2}$O($l$).

### 1.2 Phases and Classification of Matter

1. Matter $\coloneqq$ Anything that occupies space and has mass $\equiv$ Volume and Mass.
2. ($s$)($l$)($g$) $\coloneqq$ (solid)(liquid)(gas) $\to$ Most common forms of Matter on earth.
3. Mass $\coloneqq$
   1. Amount of matter $\to$ compare its mass with a standard mass.
   2. Measure of Inertia, Inertia $\coloneqq$ amount of force taken to accelerate object.

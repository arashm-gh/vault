## 1.0 The Foundations of [[Chemistry]]
#### 1.1 [[Matter]] and [[Energy]]
1. [[Matter]] $\coloneqq$ Anything that has mass and occupies space
2. [[Mass]] $\coloneqq$ Measure of matter in a substance $\Leftrightarrow$ Measure of Inertia
3. [[Energy]] $\coloneqq$ Capacity to do Work or Transfer Heat
	1. [[Kinetic Energy]] $\coloneqq$ Energy carried by an object in motion
	2. [[Potential Energy]] $\coloneqq$ Energy carried because of Position, Condition, and Composition
4. [[Exothermic]] $\coloneqq$ Processes that release energy
5. [[Endothermic]] $\coloneqq$ Processes that absorb energy
6. [[Law of Conservation of Matter]] $\coloneqq$ *"There is no observable change in the quantity of matter during a chemical reaction or ­during a physical change."*
	1. $\rightsquigarrow$ Nuclear Reactions where mass $\Leftrightarrow$ energy are *not* chemical reactions
7. [[Law of Conservation of Energy]] $\coloneqq$ *"Energy cannot be created or destroyed in a chemical reaction or in a physical change. It can only be converted from one form to another."*
8. [[Law of Conservation of Energy and Matter]] $\coloneqq$ *"The combined amount of matter and energy available in the universe is fixed."*
#### 1.2 A [[Molecules |Molecular view of Matter]]
1. [[Macroscale]] $\coloneqq$ Scale of matter that which we can see, handle, and manipulate.
2. [[Nanoscale]] $\coloneqq$ Scale of [[Atom|Atoms]] and [[Molecule|Molecules]].
3. Angtroms $\coloneqq$ One Nanometer $\Rightarrow$ Å
4. [[Dalton's Atomic Theory]]

| [[Electron]] $e^-$       | 0.0                | $-1$              |
| [[Proton]] $p$ or $p^+$  | 1.0                | $+1$              |
| [[Neutron]] $n$ or $n^0$ | 1.0                | None              |

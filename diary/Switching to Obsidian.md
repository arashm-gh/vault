After using [[Markdown]] in [[VSCode]]/[[VSCodium]]/[[Neovim]] with syncing done with git, I've decided to switch to using [[Obsidian (App)]] as my editor for the time being!
I've also decided that instead of keeping everything outside a folder I'm going to be having big folders that keep everything in order:
1. #Diary
2. #Art 
3. #Biology
4. #Chemistry
5. #Computer_Science
6. #Cuisine
7. #Culture
8. #Design
9. #Electrical_Engineering
10. #Etiquette
11. #Fashion
12. #Film
13. #Games
14. #Language
15. #Literature
16. #Mathematics
17. #Music
18. #Philosophy
19. #Physics
20. #Politics
21. #Economics 
22. #Business
23. #Sociology
24. #Programming
25. #Psychology
26. #Scene
27. #People
28. #Media
29. #Tools 
30. #Date
31. #Year
This should — pretty consistently — keep everything in order the way I want it to! So I'm gonna be doing that now.
I also need to remember to update the paths in my gitignore file **before** updating anything. 
Probably the next step after this would be to keep adding diary entries while referencing material outside them like books and stuff and then making entries for those as well after reading them!

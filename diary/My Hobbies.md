#Diary
As a kid, I loved reading and programming. I wasn't a big fan of [[Film|Films]] or [[TV Shows]] or [[Cooking]] or [[Drawing]] or even [[Painting]] but I would partake in these other activities semi-regularly out of boredom.
Now that I'm a lot older, I realize I did enjoy all of those activities and that I enjoy both consuming and [[Creating]] [[Art]] as well as [[Engineering]].
More recently (Thanks to [[The Missus]]) I've become a fan of [[Literature]] ([[Fiction]]) as well as [[Film|film]] and [[Music]]! [[Game Development]] still remains one of my greater past times, but I also enjoy playing [[Games]] more now! Which is nice.

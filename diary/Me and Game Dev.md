#Diary 
[[Game Development]] is the hobby I've spent the most time and effort on. It started when I was around 11 years old (or even younger) trying to make games in the [[Terminal]] using [[Python]]. I don't remember most of the games I made during this time because I was fairly new to [[Programming]] but one of the earliest ones I do remember is [[Colony Survival]].
Then I came across [[Brackeys]] on [[YouTube]] and got started with [[Unity]] which I used for years while I got better at [[Programming]] through [[C#]].
I made a small list of games I put up on [[Itch.io]]:
1. [[The Rouge Shape]]
2. [[Birthday Gamer]]
3. [[Quick Kitch]]
4. [[Adventurers' Inn]]
5. [[Fiverr Games]]
All of these are in ascending order by date.
There are big gaps between the dates these games were made on though. After being thoroughly disappointed with how [[The Rouge Shape]] came out in ~2019 I decided to move onto theory and just messed around with projects until I learned more about how [[Unity]] works. 
During that time I came across [[YouTube]] channels like [[DJ Peach Cobbler]], [[Super Eyepatch Wolf]], [[GMTK]], [[Daryl Talks Games]], [[Blackthorn Prod]], [[Jonas Tyroller]], and countless others. I would say I watched them pretty closely for years, and even do today.
Then after years working in [[Unity]] using [[C#]] the [[Unity Pricing Changes & Runtime Fee]] was introduced in 2024. Since then, I decided to switch to the [[Godot]] to work on games and prototype. Afterwords I took the rusty (?) pill and moved to [[Rust Game Development]].
As of writing, I'm working on some projects of my own in [[Rust]] using [[Macroquad]].

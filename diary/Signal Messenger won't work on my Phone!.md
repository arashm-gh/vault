#Diary 
I like [[Signal Messenger|Signal]]. It has all the features a girl could want, but it does also suck that after I use it for a bit, it has this shitty habit of breaking on me and I don't know what the problem is.
So maybe the idea for this month is gonna be that I make a messenger app for my phone (for [[Android]], [[Linux]], and [[Windows]] only because [[iPhone]] is terrible) to text.
I want it to have the following features:
- Secure ([[End to End Encryption|E2EE]] and all that)
- Good [[UI]]
- Customization
- Built in Image editor
- Sync across devices.

I don't own a [[Server]] to host it on or anything, which means I'll have to use some kind of [[Peer to Peer|P2P]] solution to make it work :3
